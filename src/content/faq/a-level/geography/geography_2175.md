The major threats to coral reefs today include climate change, pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing practices.

Climate change is arguably the most significant threat to coral reefs. Rising sea temperatures caused by global warming can lead to coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals expel the algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn completely white. This is harmful as the algae provide the corals with most of their food and colour. If bleaching is prolonged, corals can die. Additionally, increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leads to ocean acidification, which makes it difficult for corals to build their calcium carbonate skeletons.

Pollution, particularly from land-based sources, is another major threat. This includes agricultural runoff, which can carry pesticides and fertilisers into the ocean, and sewage discharge, which can introduce harmful nutrients and bacteria. These pollutants can cause harmful algal blooms that block sunlight, hindering coral growth and reproduction. Plastic pollution is also a concern, as corals can become entangled in or ingest plastic debris, causing injury and stress.

Overfishing and destructive fishing practices also pose significant threats. Overfishing can disrupt the balance of coral reef ecosystems, as it often targets species that control populations of coral-eating organisms. Without these predators, populations of coral-eating organisms can explode, leading to widespread coral destruction. Destructive fishing practices, such as the use of dynamite or cyanide, physically damage or destroy coral reefs.

Lastly, coastal development and tourism can also harm coral reefs. Construction activities can cause sedimentation, which smothers corals and blocks sunlight. Anchors from boats can physically damage reefs, while tourists can inadvertently harm corals by touching or standing on them. Despite these threats, coral reefs are resilient and can recover if given the chance. However, the combined impact of these threats is causing unprecedented levels of coral reef decline globally.
