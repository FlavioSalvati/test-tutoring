Marine transportation plays a minimal role in the formation of coastlines, which is predominantly shaped by natural processes.

Coastal formation is primarily influenced by natural processes such as erosion, deposition, and weathering. These processes are driven by the forces of waves, tides, currents, and wind. While marine transportation can have some indirect effects on these processes, its contribution is relatively minor.

Activities associated with marine transportation, such as shipping and boating, can disturb the water, resulting in increased wave action. This heightened wave action can contribute to the erosion of coastlines, particularly in regions experiencing heavy marine traffic. Nonetheless, the impact of marine transportation on coastal erosion is generally insignificant when compared to the powerful natural forces of waves and currents.

Moreover, dredging operations related to marine transportation can alter the seabed and disrupt sediment transport dynamics. Dredging is often performed to create deeper channels for vessels, which can lead to significant changes in the coastal landscape. For instance, the removal of sediment from the seabed can exacerbate coastal erosion, as there is less material available for deposition along the shoreline.

The construction of ports and harbors for marine transportation also affects coastal formation. These structures can interfere with the natural movement of sediment along the coast, resulting in alterations to the shape and structure of the coastline. For example, the construction of a harbor wall can obstruct longshore drift, causing sediment to accumulate on one side of the wall while leading to erosion on the opposite side.

In summary, while marine transportation does exert some influence on coastal formation, it is essential to recognize that these impacts are typically minor compared to the dominant natural processes that shape our coastlines. The primary way in which marine transportation affects coastal formation is indirectly, through the disturbances it creates in the water and the modifications it imposes on the seabed and coastline.
