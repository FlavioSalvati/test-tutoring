Mid-ocean ridges are extensive underwater mountain ranges formed through the process of plate tectonics. These ridges feature rift valleys, hydrothermal vents, and unique ecosystems that thrive in extreme conditions.

Spanning over $65,000$ kilometers, mid-ocean ridges represent the longest mountain range on Earth. They are created by seafloor spreading, a process in which tectonic plates diverge and magma rises to fill the resulting gap, generating new oceanic crust. This activity results in a ridge-like structure characterized by a central rift valley—a narrow, deep trench that runs along the length of the ridge. The formation of the rift valley is driven by the tensional forces exerted by the diverging tectonic plates, causing the newly formed crust to crack and sink.

One of the most intriguing aspects of mid-ocean ridges is the presence of hydrothermal vents. These openings in the seafloor release heated, mineral-rich water. The water is heated by the magma beneath the crust and becomes saturated with minerals as it interacts with surrounding rocks. When this superheated water encounters the cold ocean water, the minerals precipitate out, forming chimney-like structures around the vents. These hydrothermal vents host a diverse array of unique life forms that have adapted to the harsh conditions, thus forming the foundation of deep-sea ecosystems.

The geological activity at mid-ocean ridges also gives rise to pillow lavas—bulbous, rounded formations created when lava is rapidly cooled by seawater. In this process, the outer layer of lava solidifies quickly, while the interior remains molten and continues to flow, resulting in a distinctive 'pillow' shape. These formations serve as clear indicators of underwater volcanic activity.

Furthermore, mid-ocean ridges play a crucial role in the Earth's magnetic field. As new crust is generated, iron-rich minerals within the magma align themselves with the Earth's magnetic field. Over time, as the seafloor spreads, these minerals record past changes in the Earth's magnetic field. This phenomenon, known as magnetic striping, provided pivotal evidence for the development of the theory of plate tectonics.
