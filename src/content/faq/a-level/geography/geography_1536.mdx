Stepped migration is a process in which individuals or groups gradually relocate from smaller, often rural areas to larger urban centers in a series of stages.

This concept, rooted in human geography, illustrates a prevalent pattern of migration. Typically, it begins with a person or group moving from a small, rural community to a slightly larger town or city. After some time, they may choose to migrate again to an even larger urban area, and this sequence can continue over many years and through multiple generations. The underlying idea is that each step brings migrants closer to enhanced opportunities, such as improved employment prospects, educational access, healthcare services, and overall quality of life.

Stepped migration is closely linked to the broader theory of rural-urban migration, which posits that individuals are attracted to urban areas due to the perceived advantages and opportunities they offer compared to rural settings. However, the transition from a small rural community to a large metropolitan area can be significant and daunting. Consequently, many individuals prefer to navigate this transition in smaller, more manageable increments.

Social networks often play a crucial role in facilitating stepped migration. For instance, an individual may first relocate to a town where they have family or friends, which can provide essential support and assistance in acclimating to the new environment. Once they are settled and established, they may feel more empowered to make the move to a larger city.

It is important to recognize that stepped migration is not a universal phenomenon; it can be influenced by various factors, including individual circumstances, economic conditions, and government policies. For example, some individuals may opt to move directly from a rural area to a large city, bypassing intermediate steps entirely. Others may find that staying in a smaller town or city provides a favorable balance of opportunities and lifestyle, allowing them to thrive without making further migrations.
