Earth's orbital variations play a crucial role in determining the distribution of solar energy, which significantly influences global climate patterns.

The orbit of Earth around the Sun is not static; it undergoes three primary types of changes known as Milankovitch cycles. These cycles include variations in Earth's eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession. Each of these changes affects the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, subsequently impacting global climate systems.

The first type of change, eccentricity, pertains to the shape of Earth's orbit around the Sun. Over a cycle of approximately $100,000$ years, the orbit transitions from nearly circular to more elliptical. When the orbit is more elliptical, there is a greater disparity in solar energy received during different times of the year, resulting in more pronounced seasonal variations.

The second type of change, axial tilt, refers to the angle between Earth's rotational axis and the plane of its orbit. This tilt fluctuates between approximately $22.1^\circ$ and $24.5^\circ$ over a cycle of $41,000$ years. A greater axial tilt results in more extreme seasonal temperature variations, while a lesser tilt leads to milder seasonal changes.

The third type of change, precession, describes the wobble in Earth's axis of rotation. This wobble completes a cycle every $26,000$ years and alters the timing of the seasons by shifting the points in Earth's orbit where the solstices and equinoxes occur. Depending on the phase of this cycle, precession can result in warmer winters and cooler summers, or vice versa.

In summary, the changes in Earth's orbit have a profound effect on the distribution of solar energy across the planet. Over thousands of years, these variations can lead to significant climatic shifts, including the onset and retreat of ice ages. Understanding these orbital changes is essential for predicting future climate patterns and their potential impacts on human societies.
