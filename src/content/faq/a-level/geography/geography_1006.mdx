At transform plate boundaries, two tectonic plates slide past one another horizontally, leading to significant seismic activity and earthquakes.

Transform plate boundaries, often referred to as conservative plate boundaries, are distinctive because they neither generate nor consume lithosphere, in contrast to divergent and convergent boundaries. In these regions, tectonic plates move parallel to each other in opposite directions. This horizontal motion arises from the differing rates of seafloor spreading at divergent boundaries, which causes the plates to grind against each other.

A well-known example of a transform boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California, where the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate slide alongside each other. This movement is not always smooth; the plates can become stuck at certain locations due to friction. When the stress on the rock layers surpasses the rock's strength, energy is released in the form of seismic waves, resulting in earthquakes.

Transform boundaries also contribute to the formation of linear valleys or undersea canyons, known as fracture zones. These features are deep, seismically active troughs that run perpendicular to mid-ocean ridges. The horizontal movement of the plates along these zones can displace substantial volumes of water, potentially triggering tsunamis.

Although transform boundaries do not create large landforms such as mountains or ocean trenches, they significantly alter the landscape through the seismic activity they generate. The continual movement and interaction of the plates can lead to the development of fault lines and cracks on the Earth's surface. Consequently, these boundaries are closely monitored due to their potential to cause destructive earthquakes and tsunamis.
