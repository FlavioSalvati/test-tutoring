Fertility rates and economic growth exhibit an inverse relationship; typically, high fertility rates are associated with lower economic growth.

Fertility rates represent the average number of children a woman is expected to have during her reproductive years. In contrast, economic growth refers to the increase in the inflation-adjusted market value of goods and services produced by an economy over time. The interplay between these two factors is intricate and multifaceted. Generally, higher fertility rates correlate with decreased economic growth, and vice versa.

In nations with elevated fertility rates, resources that could otherwise be allocated for economic development are often redirected to meet the basic needs of a large population. These needs include food, healthcare, and education. As the population grows, the demand for resources increases, which can strain the economy and impede economic growth. Furthermore, high fertility rates can lead to a significant dependency ratio, where a large segment of the population consists of children who are not yet able to contribute economically. This situation can further obstruct economic progress.

Conversely, countries with lower fertility rates tend to experience higher economic growth. With fewer dependents to support, more resources can be invested in enhancing infrastructure, technology, and other sectors that contribute to economic development. Additionally, lower fertility rates can result in a demographic dividend, characterized by a larger working-age population compared to the non-working-age population. This demographic shift can boost productivity and stimulate economic growth.

However, it is crucial to recognize that this relationship is not always straightforward. Numerous factors, including government policies, cultural norms, and economic structures, can influence both fertility rates and economic growth. For instance, some countries with low fertility rates may still face challenges in achieving economic growth due to issues such as corruption, poor governance, or limited access to education and healthcare. Similarly, some nations with high fertility rates may experience economic growth driven by factors like abundant natural resources or robust export industries.
