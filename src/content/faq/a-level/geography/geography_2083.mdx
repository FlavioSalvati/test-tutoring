Wind is a key factor in the formation and transformation of coastal dunes, as it effectively transports and deposits sand, leading to the development of diverse dune shapes and sizes.

The process begins when wind, serving as the primary agent of change, lifts loose, dry sand from the beach and carries it inland. This mechanism of sand movement is referred to as saltation. As the wind's speed decreases, the sand is deposited, resulting in the formation of mounds that gradually evolve into dunes. The characteristics of these dunes—such as their size and shape—are influenced by several factors, including wind speed, wind direction, and the quantity of sand available.

Wind direction is particularly significant in determining the morphology of the dunes. Prevailing winds, which consistently blow from a specific direction, lead to the creation of asymmetrical dunes. The side that faces the wind, known as the windward side, typically has a gentle slope, while the side that is sheltered from the wind, referred to as the leeward side, is steeper. This asymmetry arises because sand is carried up the milder incline and then cascades down the steeper drop.

Moreover, the intensity of the wind is crucial in shaping these dunes. Stronger winds have the capacity to transport larger volumes of sand, which can result in the formation of larger dunes. In contrast, weaker winds are limited in their ability to move sand, resulting in the development of smaller dunes.

Additionally, wind can significantly alter existing dunes. During storm events, powerful winds can erode the dunes, leading to changes in their shape and size. Over time, this can result in complex dune systems featuring a wide variety of shapes and sizes.

In summary, wind is an essential element in the formation and shaping of coastal dunes. It not only initiates the process of dune formation through the transport and deposition of sand but also plays a crucial role in influencing the size, shape, and complexity of these dynamic features.
