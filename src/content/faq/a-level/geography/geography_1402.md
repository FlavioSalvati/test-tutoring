The concept of optimum population differs significantly between developed and developing countries, influenced by factors such as economic productivity, resource availability, and standards of living.

In developed countries, optimum population is closely associated with the equilibrium between population size and resource availability. These nations generally experience lower population growth rates and enjoy higher standards of living. A population is deemed optimum when the country's resources can adequately meet the needs and desires of its inhabitants while sustaining a high quality of life. For example, countries like Japan and Germany exhibit relatively low population growth rates; however, their robust economic productivity and advanced technologies empower them to maintain a high standard of living. Consequently, their optimum population is relatively low in comparison to their total land area.

Conversely, in developing countries, the notion of optimum population is more intricate. These nations often face high population growth rates, yet their available resources and economic productivity typically fall short of sustaining the population's needs and desires. As a result, the optimum population in these contexts is frequently considered to be lower than the actual population. Take, for instance, countries like India and Nigeria, which experience significant population growth rates but lack the necessary resources and economic productivity to ensure a high standard of living for all citizens. Thus, their optimum population is regarded as lower than their current population levels.

Additionally, the concept of optimum population is also contingent upon a country's level of technological advancement. Developed nations with sophisticated technologies can support a larger population with the same quantity of resources compared to developing nations that utilize less advanced technology. Hence, the optimum population in developed countries can be greater than that in developing countries, even when both have similar land areas.

In summary, the concept of optimum population varies between developed and developing countries influenced by factors such as economic productivity, resource availability, living standards, and technological advancement.
