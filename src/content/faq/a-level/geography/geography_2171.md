Water temperature significantly impacts coral reefs, with both unusually cold and warm temperatures causing stress and potential bleaching.

Coral reefs are highly sensitive to temperature changes. They thrive in warm, tropical waters, but only within a specific temperature range, typically between 20-29°C. When water temperatures rise above or fall below this range, corals can become stressed, leading to a phenomenon known as coral bleaching.

Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, known as zooxanthellae. These algae provide the coral with essential nutrients through photosynthesis and give them their vibrant colours. When the algae are expelled, the coral turns white or 'bleaches'. This is often a response to stress, such as changes in temperature, light, or nutrients.

When water temperatures rise, often due to global warming, corals can bleach and eventually die if the temperature does not return to normal quickly enough. This is because, without the zooxanthellae, the coral struggles to get enough nutrients to survive. The 1998 El Niño event, for example, led to a global coral bleaching event where 16% of the world's reefs died due to unusually warm ocean temperatures.

On the other hand, unusually cold water temperatures can also cause coral bleaching. For instance, in 2010, Florida's coral reefs experienced a severe bleaching event due to an unusually cold winter. The cold temperatures caused the corals to become stressed and expel their zooxanthellae, leading to widespread bleaching.

In conclusion, water temperature plays a crucial role in the health of coral reefs. Both unusually warm and cold temperatures can cause stress to corals, leading to bleaching and potentially death. As global temperatures continue to fluctuate due to climate change, understanding and mitigating the impacts of temperature changes on coral reefs is becoming increasingly important.
