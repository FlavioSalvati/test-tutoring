Human activities have a profound impact on tropical limestone landforms through processes such as deforestation, quarrying, pollution, and climate change.

One of the most significant activities affecting limestone landscapes is deforestation. The removal of trees eliminates the roots that stabilize the soil, resulting in increased soil erosion. This erosion exposes the underlying limestone to weathering and dissolution, which can dramatically alter the landscape. For example, the loss of vegetation can facilitate the formation of sinkholes, caves, and various other karst features.

Quarrying is another critical activity that directly alters limestone landforms. Limestone is an essential resource utilized in construction, agriculture, and various industries. Consequently, vast areas of limestone are often excavated, leading to substantial changes in the terrain. This not only detracts from the natural beauty of these regions but also disrupts local ecosystems and can result in a significant loss of biodiversity.

Pollution, especially in the form of acid rain, further affects limestone landforms. Acid rain is produced from the emission of sulfur and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, primarily due to the combustion of fossil fuels. When this acidic precipitation interacts with limestone, it accelerates the dissolution process compared to natural conditions. This rapid dissolution can lead to the development of more extensive and numerous karst features, including sinkholes and caves.

Finally, human-induced climate change also impacts limestone landscapes. Rising temperatures may increase the rates of chemical weathering, including the dissolution of limestone. Additionally, shifts in rainfall patterns can influence the erosion and dissolution rates of limestone. For instance, increased rainfall can result in more rapid dissolution, while decreased rainfall may cause limestone surfaces to dry out and harden.

In summary, human activities such as deforestation, quarrying, pollution, and climate change significantly affect limestone landforms in tropical regions. These actions can lead to substantial alterations in the landscape, a decline in biodiversity, and the emergence of new karst features.
