A country in Stage 2 of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM) experiences high birth rates coupled with rapidly declining death rates.

In this second stage of the DTM, significant shifts occur in the population dynamics of a country. This stage is frequently linked to industrialization, along with advancements in healthcare and sanitation, which contribute to a marked decrease in death rates. However, birth rates tend to remain high due to prevailing cultural norms and limited access to or use of contraception. As a result, the population experiences a rapid increase, often referred to as a population explosion.

The elevated birth rates in Stage 2 are often rooted in traditional societal values that favor larger families. In many cultures, children are viewed as a source of labor and a form of security for parents in their later years. Furthermore, the lack of widespread education, particularly among women, often limits the use of family planning methods.

Conversely, the decline in death rates is largely attributed to advancements in medical technology and improved living conditions. The introduction of vaccines and antibiotics, enhanced sanitation practices, and better access to clean water have significantly reduced the prevalence of diseases, leading to lower infant and child mortality rates. Additionally, improvements in food production and distribution contribute to better nutrition and health outcomes, further decreasing death rates.

Despite the rapid population growth, countries in Stage 2 of the DTM are typically characterized by a predominantly young population. This demographic trend arises from the combination of high birth rates and relatively low life expectancy. A young population presents both challenges and opportunities for a country. On one hand, it can place a strain on resources and services, such as education and healthcare. On the other hand, if effectively harnessed, this demographic can provide a substantial labor force that fuels economic growth.

In summary, Stage 2 of the DTM is characterized by elevated birth rates, a sharp decline in death rates, and a rapidly growing population that is predominantly young.
