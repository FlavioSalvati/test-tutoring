Hotspots play a crucial role in the formation of volcanic islands by generating a series of volcanoes as tectonic plates shift and move.

A hotspot is an area of intense heat located within the Earth's mantle. Unlike tectonic plates, hotspots are stationary and produce significant amounts of molten rock, known as magma. This magma ascends through the Earth's crust, resulting in the formation of a volcano. As the tectonic plate above the hotspot continues to move, the volcano travels with it. Eventually, the volcano becomes inactive when it is cut off from its magma source. However, the hotspot remains stationary, and a new volcano begins to form directly above it. This cycle repeats over millions of years, leading to the creation of a chain of volcanic islands.

A prime example of this phenomenon is the Hawaiian Islands. The Pacific Plate has been moving over a hotspot for millions of years, resulting in the formation of the island chain we observe today. The oldest islands, which are now extinct volcanoes, are located farthest from the hotspot, while the youngest and still-active volcanoes, such as $Kilauea$ and $Mauna \, Loa$ on the Big Island, are situated directly above the hotspot.

The Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean also illustrate hotspot activity. In this case, the Nazca Plate is moving over a hotspot, giving rise to the archipelago. The western islands are younger and remain volcanically active, while the eastern islands are older and are undergoing erosion.

While hotspots are a significant mechanism for island formation, other processes such as subduction and continental rifting also contribute to the creation of islands. Nevertheless, hotspot activity offers a unique method of island formation, resulting in distinctive chains of islands across the worldâ€™s oceans. Understanding this process is essential for geographers and geologists studying plate tectonics and the Earth's geological history.
