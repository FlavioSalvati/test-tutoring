Living shorelines are used in coastal management to protect coastlines from erosion and promote ecosystem health through natural methods.

Living shorelines are a relatively new approach to coastal management that emphasises the use of natural materials and systems to protect and restore coastlines. They are designed to mimic natural coastal systems, using plants, sand, and sometimes rock to stabilise the shoreline and reduce the impact of waves and storm surges. This approach is often more sustainable and less disruptive to local ecosystems than traditional hard structures like seawalls and groynes.

One of the main benefits of living shorelines is their ability to adapt to changing conditions. Unlike hard structures, which can fail if conditions exceed their design parameters, living shorelines can grow and change with the environment. This makes them particularly useful in areas where sea levels are rising or where storm patterns are changing due to climate change.

Living shorelines also provide important habitat for a variety of species. The plants used in these projects can provide food and shelter for birds, fish, and other wildlife, helping to maintain biodiversity in coastal areas. In addition, the roots of these plants can help to trap sediment and nutrients, improving water quality and reducing the impact of pollution.

However, living shorelines are not suitable for all locations. They require a certain amount of space and are not effective in areas with high wave energy. They can also be more expensive and time-consuming to install than traditional structures. Despite these challenges, the use of living shorelines is becoming increasingly popular as a way to manage coastlines in a more sustainable and ecologically friendly way.
