Beach drift, also referred to as longshore drift, is a vital process in coastal sediment transport. It describes the movement of sand and pebbles along the shoreline, primarily driven by the action of waves and currents. This process is essential for shaping the coastal landscape and contributes to the formation of various features, such as spits, bars, and tombolos.

The process of beach drift begins when waves approach the shore at an angle, a phenomenon known as wave approach. This angled approach results in the swash— the forward movement of water that occurs after a wave breaks— carrying sediment up the beach in the direction of the incoming wave. Subsequently, the backwash— the flow of water returning to the sea— transports sediment directly down the beach due to gravitational pull. This interplay creates a zigzag pattern of sediment movement, characteristic of beach drift.

The direction of beach drift is largely influenced by the prevailing wind direction, which affects how waves approach the shore. For instance, in the UK, the predominant wind direction comes from the southwest, leading to a significant northeastward transport of sediment along the eastern coastline.

The rate of beach drift can vary based on several factors, including the size and energy of the waves, the slope and composition of the beach, and the amount of available sediment. Generally, larger and more powerful waves can move more sediment at a quicker pace. Additionally, a steeper beach gradient tends to enhance the speed of the backwash, further facilitating sediment transport.

In summary, beach drift is a complex process shaped by multiple factors. It plays a crucial role in coastal transportation, contributing to the dynamic and constantly evolving nature of our coastlines.
