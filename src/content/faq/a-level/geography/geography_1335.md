Demographic transition significantly influences global population distribution by prompting a movement of populations from rural to urban areas and from developing to developed regions.

Demographic transition describes the process through which a nation shifts from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates as it progresses from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economic system. This transition is often accompanied by a notable change in population distribution, characterized by an increasing number of individuals relocating from rural settings to urban centers in pursuit of improved economic opportunities. The phenomenon of urbanization can result in the expansion of cities and the decline of rural areas, thereby altering the spatial distribution of the population.

During the early phases of demographic transition, birth rates remain high while death rates begin to decline, resulting in rapid population growth. This scenario is frequently observed in developing nations where agriculture serves as the primary source of income, and children are perceived as economic assets. As these countries undergo industrialization and development, there is a marked shift towards urban living, leading to a redistribution of the population.

In the later stages of demographic transition, both birth and death rates are low, culminating in a slowly growing and eventually declining population. This trend is commonly found in developed countries characterized by high levels of urbanization and a transition towards knowledge-based economies. Consequently, population distribution in these nations tends to be highly concentrated in urban areas.

Moreover, demographic transition also affects international migration patterns. As individuals in developing countries seek better economic prospects, they may opt to migrate to developed nations, which results in a redistribution of the global population. This migration can lead to significant demographic changes in both the countries of origin and the host countries.

In summary, demographic transition plays a crucial role in shaping global population distribution. It impacts the movement of people within countries—from rural regions to urban centers—and between countries, from developing to developed areas. This transition can lead to substantial changes in how populations are spatially distributed, with important implications for urban planning, resource allocation, and social and economic policies.
