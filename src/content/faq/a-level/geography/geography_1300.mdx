The structure of a population is closely tied to a country's position within the Demographic Transition Model (DTM), which illustrates the interplay between birth, death, and migration rates.

The Demographic Transition Model (DTM) is a framework utilized by geographers to characterize the shift from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates as a nation progresses from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economic system. This transition is typically depicted through a series of stages, each characterized by a unique population structure.

In **Stage 1**, both birth and death rates are elevated, resulting in a relatively stable yet low population. The population structure in this stage exhibits a broad base, indicating a large number of young individuals, and a narrow top, which signifies fewer older individuals due to high mortality rates. This pattern is commonly observed in less economically developed countries.

In **Stage 2**, death rates begin to decline as improvements in medical care, sanitation, and food availability take effect. However, birth rates remain high, leading to rapid population growth. Here, the population pyramid continues to display a broad base, but the top becomes slightly wider, reflecting the increase in life expectancy.

**Stage 3** is marked by a decline in birth rates, driven by changing social attitudes and greater access to contraception. Although the population continues to grow, the rate of growth slows down. The shape of the population pyramid begins to resemble a bell curve, with fewer young people and an increasing number of middle-aged individuals.

In **Stage 4**, both birth and death rates are low, resulting in a stable population. The population pyramid in this stage takes on a more uniform shape, indicative of an aging population and a smaller proportion of young individuals. This demographic pattern is typical of more economically developed countries.

Some models propose a **Stage 5**, where birth rates fall below death rates, leading to a declining population. In this scenario, the population pyramid displays a narrow base, reflecting a reduced number of young people, and a broad top, indicating a larger elderly population. Countries such as Japan and Germany exemplify this stage.

In summary, the population structure of a country offers valuable insights into its stage in the Demographic Transition Model and its socio-economic development trajectory.
