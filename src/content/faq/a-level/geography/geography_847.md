Cloud cover tends to increase with latitude and varies with the seasons, typically being more prevalent in winter compared to summer.

Cloud cover, defined as the percentage of the sky obscured by clouds, is influenced by several factors, including latitude and seasonal changes. Latitude indicates a location's distance north or south of the equator, which plays a crucial role in determining the amount of solar radiation a region receives. Near the equator, where the sun's rays strike the Earth most directly, there is a high rate of evaporation that contributes to cloud formation. In contrast, as one moves toward the poles, the sun's rays become more oblique, leading to reduced evaporation and, consequently, less cloud cover. As a result, cloud cover generally increases from the equator up to about $60^\circ$ latitude before decreasing again toward the poles.

Seasonal variations in cloud cover are primarily driven by changes in solar radiation and atmospheric circulation patterns. During winter, the sun's rays are more oblique, resulting in diminished evaporation and cloud formation. However, the cooler temperatures mean that the atmosphere can hold less moisture before condensation occurs. This, along with the fact that winter is usually characterized by more active weather systems, contributes to increased cloud cover during this season. In contrast, summer brings more direct sunlight, which leads to greater evaporation and potential cloud formation. Nevertheless, the warmer air can hold more moisture before it condenses into clouds, and there are generally fewer active weather systems, resulting in reduced cloud cover during the summer months.

Additionally, local factors such as topography and proximity to bodies of water can significantly influence cloud cover patterns. For instance, mountainous regions often experience higher cloud cover due to orographic lift, while coastal areas may see increased cloudiness owing to the moderating effects of the ocean.
