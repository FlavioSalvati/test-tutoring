Human activities significantly amplify the risks associated with mass movements through practices such as deforestation, urbanization, mining, and ineffective land management.

Deforestation is a major factor contributing to the increased risk of mass movements. Trees and vegetation play an essential role in stabilizing slopes by absorbing water and anchoring the soil with their root systems. When humans clear forests for timber or agricultural expansion, they remove this natural barrier, leaving the land more vulnerable to landslides and other forms of mass movement. This issue is particularly severe in regions with heavy rainfall, where the absence of trees allows the soil to become saturated, leading to instability.

Urbanization further elevates the risk of mass movements. As urban areas expand, they often encroach upon hilly or mountainous terrains, where the likelihood of landslides is naturally higher. The construction of buildings and roads can destabilize slopes, especially when excavation into hillsides occurs. Additionally, the increase in runoff from impermeable surfaces such as roads and pavements can exacerbate soil saturation, heightening the potential for mass movements.

Mining activities also contribute to the increased risk of mass movements. The extraction of minerals typically involves the removal of substantial quantities of soil and rock, which can destabilize the land and trigger landslides. Moreover, the waste material produced during mining, known as tailings, is often stored in large dams that can fail, resulting in catastrophic landslides.

Lastly, poor land management practices can intensify the risk of mass movements. Overgrazing by livestock can deplete vegetation cover, making the land more susceptible to erosion and landslides. Similarly, inadequate irrigation practices can lead to soil saturation and instability. In some instances, the inappropriate use of heavy machinery can compact the soil, diminishing its capacity to absorb water and further increasing the likelihood of mass movements.
