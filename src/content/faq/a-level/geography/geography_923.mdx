Acid rain is a type of precipitation that is considerably more acidic than normal rain, primarily caused by atmospheric pollution.

This phenomenon occurs as a result of industrial activities that release sulfur dioxide ($\text{SO}_2$) and nitrogen oxides ($\text{NO}_x$) into the atmosphere. These gases can ascend to high altitudes, where they interact with water, oxygen, and other chemicals, forming more acidic pollutants collectively referred to as acid rain. Importantly, this issue is not restricted to just rain; it also encompasses snow, fog, and fine particles that settle as dry deposition.

The main sources of $\text{SO}_2$ and $\text{NO}_x$ emissions include the combustion of fossil fuels, commonly from power plants and motor vehicles. When these fuels are burned, they release significant quantities of these gases into the atmosphere. Additionally, natural events such as volcanic eruptions and the decomposition of organic matter can also contribute to the release of $\text{SO}_2$, further facilitating the formation of acid rain.

The environmental consequences of acid rain can be quite severe. It has the potential to acidify aquatic ecosystems, which can lead to the decline or extinction of various aquatic species. Furthermore, acid rain can damage forests by leaching essential nutrients from the soil that trees require for growth and survival. Beyond environmental impacts, acid rain can also pose health risks to humans, particularly affecting the respiratory system.

A notable aspect of acid rain is that it is not confined to the regions where the pollutants are emitted. Wind patterns can transport these pollutants over considerable distances, resulting in acid rain falling in locations far removed from the original sources of pollution. This characteristic makes acid rain a transboundary issue, impacting areas and countries that may not be major contributors to the pollution.

In recent years, various initiatives have been undertaken to mitigate the emissions of $\text{SO}_2$ and $\text{NO}_x$ through the adoption of cleaner technologies and the implementation of stricter regulations. Despite these efforts, acid rain continues to present a significant environmental challenge, particularly in industrialized regions.
