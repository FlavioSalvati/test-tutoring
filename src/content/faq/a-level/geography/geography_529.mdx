Below-ground flows play a crucial role in contributing to a river's discharge by providing a consistent supply of water through groundwater and baseflow.

These below-ground flows, often referred to as baseflow or groundwater flow, are vital for maintaining the volume of water in rivers, especially during periods of low rainfall. Water that has been stored in the ground from prior precipitation events gradually seeps into the river, ensuring a reliable flow of water even when surface runoff is minimal.

Groundwater consists of water that has permeated the soil and is stored in underground reservoirs known as aquifers. This water can traverse through the soil and rock layers, following the natural gradient of the landscape, and eventually discharges into rivers and streams. This movement is described as groundwater flow. The rate at which groundwater flows into a river can fluctuate based on several factors, including the permeability of the soil and rock, the volume of recent rainfall, and the slope of the land.

Baseflow represents the portion of a river's discharge that originates from groundwater. It is particularly critical during dry spells when there is minimal or no rainfall to replenish the river. In the absence of baseflow, many rivers could completely dry up during these arid periods. In fact, baseflow can account for a significant portion of a river's total discharge, often exceeding 50% in some cases.

In addition to ensuring a steady water supply, below-ground flows also play a role in regulating the temperature of the river. Groundwater typically remains cooler than surface water during the summer months and warmer during the winter. This temperature regulation is essential for the health of aquatic ecosystems, as many species of fish and other aquatic organisms are sensitive to fluctuations in water temperature.

In summary, below-ground flows are integral to a river's discharge in multiple ways. They provide a consistent supply of water, help regulate river temperatures, and can constitute a substantial fraction of the total flow in certain rivers.
