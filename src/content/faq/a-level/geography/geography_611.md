Base flow plays a vital role in the formation of hydrographs by supplying a steady and continuous flow of water into a river system.

Also referred to as groundwater flow, base flow is the portion of a river's discharge that originates from subsurface sources. It consists of water that seeps into the river from the ground, particularly during periods of low rainfall. This process is slow and consistent, ensuring a reliable supply of water to the river even during dry spells. Consequently, base flow is often described as the 'background' or 'normal' flow of a river.

In the context of hydrograph formation—graphs that illustrate the rate of flow (discharge) over time at a specific point in a river—base flow is depicted as a line representing the normal discharge level. This line tends to show minimal fluctuation, reflecting the stable contribution of base flow.

When a rainfall event occurs, the river's discharge rises above this base flow line. This increase is termed storm flow or direct runoff, representing the water that rapidly enters the river following rainfall, either by flowing over the ground surface or percolating through the soil. The peak of the hydrograph indicates the maximum discharge following the rainfall event.

Subsequently, after the rainfall has ceased, the discharge gradually decreases, returning to the base flow level. This phase is referred to as the recession limb of the hydrograph. The rate at which this decline occurs can be affected by various factors, including the type of soil and vegetation present in the catchment area, as well as the intensity and duration of the rainfall.

In summary, base flow is essential to hydrograph formation, providing the steady and continuous flow that establishes the baseline of the hydrograph. This baseline is critical for measuring the impacts of rainfall events on river discharge.
