Alluvial fans are geomorphological features that develop when a river or stream transporting sediment transitions from a steep gradient to a flatter plain. This abrupt change in slope results in a significant loss of energy, causing the river's flow to slow down. As the flow decelerates, the river is unable to carry the same volume of sediment, leading to the deposition of heavier particles first, followed by lighter ones. This phenomenon is referred to as deposition.

The sediment is distributed in a fan-like shape, which is why these formations are called 'alluvial fans'. The specific shape of the fan is influenced by the flow of water: if the flow is relatively straight, the resulting fan will tend to be more cone-shaped. Conversely, if the flow disperses more widely, the fan will appear broader. The dimensions of the fan are determined by both the volume of sediment being transported by the river and the duration of the sediment deposition process.

The sediment that composes an alluvial fan is typically sorted by particle size. Larger, heavier particles are deposited first, near the apex of the fan, while smaller, lighter particles are carried further downstream before being deposited. This sorting of sediment is known as grading.

Alluvial fans play a crucial role in arid and semi-arid regions, where flash floods can transport significant amounts of sediment from mountainous areas onto flatter plains. They are also present in temperate regions, where rivers flow from steep mountains into broader valleys. Alluvial fans can be observed in various locations around the globe, from the foothills of the Himalayas to the deserts of the American Southwest. These features serve as a powerful reminder of the dynamic forces of water and the ongoing processes of erosion and deposition that shape our landscapes.
