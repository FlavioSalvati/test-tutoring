Rock types have a significant influence on river channel morphology, affecting erosion rates, sediment supply, and channel stability.

Different rock types exhibit varying levels of resistance to erosion, which directly impacts the shape and size of river channels. For instance, harder rocks such as granite and basalt are more resistant to erosion, resulting in narrow, steep-sided channels. In contrast, softer rocks like sandstone and limestone erode more readily, leading to wider, shallower channels. The rate of erosion also affects the volume of sediment that a river can transport. Rivers that flow over erosion-resistant rocks tend to carry less sediment, while those that traverse easily erodible materials can carry more sediment, which can contribute to the formation of features such as bars and islands.

Additionally, the type of rock influences the stability of the river channel. Channels situated on stable, cohesive rocks like clay are less likely to change course, thus maintaining a relatively straight path. Conversely, channels over loose, non-cohesive materials like sand are more susceptible to meandering, as the river can easily erode and deposit sediment, gradually altering its course over time.

Furthermore, the rock type can affect the river's gradient. Rivers flowing over hard, resistant rocks typically exhibit a steeper gradient, as these materials are less prone to erosion. This steepness can lead to the formation of rapids and waterfalls. In contrast, rivers that flow over softer rocks tend to have a gentler gradient, as these rocks are more easily eroded, resulting in a more meandering river course.

In summary, the underlying rock type of a river channel plays a crucial role in shaping its morphology. By influencing various factors such as erosion rates, sediment supply, channel stability, and gradient, different rock types contribute to a diverse array of river channel shapes and sizes.
