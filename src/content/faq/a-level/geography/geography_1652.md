Economic disparities are a significant catalyst for international migration, compelling individuals to seek improved economic opportunities and living conditions abroad.

Economic disparities encompass the differences in wealth, income, and standard of living across various regions or countries. These inequalities can serve as a powerful motivator for individuals and families facing economic hardship in their home countries. When people are struggling to make ends meet, they may opt to migrate to nations that they perceive as offering better prospects for a higher quality of life. This perception often stems from the belief that wealthier countries provide superior job opportunities, higher wages, and enhanced living standards.

The push-pull theory of migration offers a valuable framework for understanding this phenomenon. "Push factors" are conditions that compel individuals to leave their home countries, which, in the context of economic disparities, may include poverty, unemployment, and a lack of economic opportunities. Conversely, "pull factors" are those that attract individuals to a new country, such as higher wages, available job opportunities, and better living conditions.

For instance, consider an individual residing in a developing country characterized by high poverty and unemployment rates. This person may choose to migrate to a developed nation, believing they can secure a job that pays a higher wage. This pattern is prevalent in international migration, with many individuals moving from less economically developed countries (LEDCs) to more economically developed countries (MEDCs).

However, it is crucial to recognize that economic disparities are not the sole drivers of international migration. Additional factors, including political instability, conflict, environmental challenges, and social dynamics, also significantly influence migration decisions. Moreover, the choice to migrate is often multifaceted, involving various personal, familial, and societal considerations. Nevertheless, economic disparities continue to be a primary motivator for international migration, as individuals and families strive to enhance their economic circumstances and future prospects.
