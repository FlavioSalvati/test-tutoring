Temperature fluctuations significantly influence slope processes, primarily through a phenomenon known as freeze-thaw weathering. This process is particularly relevant in regions that experience cycles of freezing and thawing.

When water infiltrates cracks in rocks and subsequently freezes, it expands by approximately $9\%$. This expansion generates considerable pressure on the surrounding rock, causing it to weaken and ultimately fracture. Each freeze-thaw cycle repeats this process of disintegration, leading to the gradual breakdown of the rock material.

The resulting disintegrated rock, often referred to as scree, accumulates on the slope, contributing to its instability. Over time, the accumulation of this material can trigger slope movements such as landslides, rockfalls, and debris flows. These movements are critical slope processes that not only shape the landscape but also pose significant risks to human activities in the vicinity.

In addition to affecting rock stability, temperature fluctuations also influence the moisture content of soil on slopes. During warmer periods, increased evaporation can lead to soil drying, which reduces its cohesive strength, making it more vulnerable to erosion and movement. Conversely, during colder periods, the freezing of soil can result in the formation of ice lenses. These ice lenses can push soil particles apart, contributing to a type of slope movement known as solifluction.

In summary, temperature fluctuations play a crucial role in slope processes. Through freeze-thaw weathering, they facilitate the disintegration of rock and the destabilization of slopes. Furthermore, these fluctuations impact the moisture content and structural integrity of soil, further influencing slope stability and movement.
