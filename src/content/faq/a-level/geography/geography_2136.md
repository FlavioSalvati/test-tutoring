Coastal management practices play a crucial role in shaping landform changes by modifying natural processes such as erosion, deposition, and sediment transportation.

Coastal management encompasses a variety of activities and strategies designed to protect and preserve coastal environments. These practices can have a significant impact on the configuration and structure of coastal landforms. For example, the construction of sea walls, groynes, and breakwaters can disrupt the natural movement of water and sediment along the coastline. This alteration can affect the rates of coastal erosion and deposition, ultimately reshaping the coastline itself.

Sea walls are built to shield the coast from wave action and prevent erosion. However, they can inadvertently cause the beach in front of them to narrow or even disappear entirely due to the reflection of wave energy. This phenomenon can result in heightened erosion further along the coast. In contrast, groynes are constructed perpendicular to the shoreline to trap sediment and slow down longshore drift. While they can promote beach accumulation on one side, they may deprive the opposite side of sediment, leading to increased erosion there.

Beach nourishment, another prevalent coastal management method, involves adding sand or shingle to a beach to replenish eroded materials. While this practice can help sustain the size and shape of the beach, it can also disrupt natural processes and affect local ecosystems. Furthermore, beach nourishment is often a temporary solution, as the newly added material can be rapidly eroded away.

Managed retreat is a more contemporary approach that involves allowing certain coastal areas to erode and flood naturally. This strategy can lead to the emergence of new habitats, such as salt marshes and mudflats, which can absorb wave energy and mitigate coastal erosion. However, it may also result in the loss of land and property.

In summary, coastal management practices significantly influence landform changes by altering the natural processes of erosion, deposition, and sediment transportation. The effects of these practices can vary widely, influenced by factors such as the type of coastline, local climate conditions, and the specific management strategies implemented.
