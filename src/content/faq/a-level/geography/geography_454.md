Major Transnational Corporations (TNCs) have experienced substantial growth, characterized by a complex network of subsidiaries and affiliates operating across multiple countries.

TNCs, also referred to as multinational corporations, are large firms that conduct business in several nations. Typically, they have their headquarters in one country—often where they were originally established—while maintaining subsidiaries or affiliates in various other locations. The expansion of TNCs has been fueled by globalization, technological advancements, and the liberalization of trade and investment.

Globalization has facilitated the expansion of TNCs across national borders, owing to the increased interconnectedness of countries through trade, investment, and technology. TNCs capitalize on this by establishing operations in countries that offer access to inexpensive labor, abundant raw materials, and emerging markets. Consequently, this has resulted in a significant increase in their size and influence on the global stage.

Technological advancements have also been instrumental in the growth of TNCs. The emergence of information and communication technologies has streamlined the coordination of operations across diverse countries. This capability allows TNCs to leverage economies of scale, minimize costs, and enhance efficiency.

Furthermore, the liberalization of trade and investment has opened up new opportunities for TNCs to expand their operations. Many nations have reduced trade barriers and welcomed foreign investment, enabling TNCs to enter previously inaccessible markets and obtain resources that were once out of reach.

The organizational structure of TNCs is intricate and can vary significantly from one corporation to another. However, most TNCs adopt a hierarchical structure, with the headquarters at the apex, followed by regional offices, and then subsidiaries or affiliates in various countries. The headquarters is responsible for strategic decision-making, while regional offices and subsidiaries execute operations. This organizational framework allows TNCs to adapt to local market conditions while maintaining oversight and control over their global activities.
