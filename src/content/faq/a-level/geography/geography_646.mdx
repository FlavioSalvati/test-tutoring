River terraces are unique landforms that develop alongside river valleys as a result of erosion and deposition processes, significantly influenced by fluctuations in climate and sea level. The formation of river terraces involves two primary stages: downcutting and aggradation.

During periods of climate change, especially during transitions from glacial to interglacial periods, rivers often undergo alterations in their flow regimes. This can result in increased erosion, known as downcutting, of the riverbed and banks. As the river carves deeper into the landscape, it creates flat, elevated surfaces on either side of the valley, marking the first stage in the formation of a river terrace.

The second stage, aggradation, occurs when the river’s flow regime shifts again, typically due to a slowdown in sea-level rise or changes in climate. This transition leads to a reduction in the river's energy, prompting the river to deposit sediment onto its bed. Over time, this accumulation of sediment elevates the riverbed, while the original flat surfaces on both sides of the valley remain intact, resulting in the creation of a terrace.

The processes of downcutting and aggradation can repeat multiple times, giving rise to a series of terraces at varying heights along the river valley. These terraces serve as a geological record of the river’s history, reflecting changes in climate and sea level over time.

It is essential to recognize that the formation of river terraces is a complex phenomenon influenced by various factors, including the region's geology, the river's gradient, and human activities. Consequently, the appearance and characteristics of river terraces can differ significantly from one location to another.
