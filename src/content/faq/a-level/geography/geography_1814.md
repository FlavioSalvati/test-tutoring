Land value plays a critical role in shaping the distribution of urban functions, as it directly influences the type and intensity of land use.

In urban environments, land value is typically determined by several key factors, including location, accessibility, and development potential. High-value land, often located in city centers, is predominantly allocated for commercial and business purposes. Businesses are willing to pay a premium for these prime locations due to their visibility, accessibility, and the high volume of foot traffic. Consequently, these areas frequently emerge as the economic hubs of cities, characterized by a dense concentration of offices, retail shops, and services.

Conversely, lower-value land, typically situated on the outskirts of cities or in less desirable locations, is generally utilized for residential, industrial, or agricultural purposes. These land uses do not require high foot traffic or visibility, allowing them to be situated in areas with reduced land values. This pattern results in a distinct spatial distribution of urban functions, with various parts of the city designated for different activities.

Moreover, land value significantly impacts the intensity of its use. In high-value areas, there is often an impetus to maximize space utilization. This leads to the construction of high-rise buildings and the vertical integration of functions, such as having retail stores on the ground floor with offices or residential apartments above. In contrast, lower-value areas tend to have less intensive land use, characterized by more open spaces and lower-density development.

In summary, land value is a fundamental factor in determining the distribution of urban functions. It not only affects the types of land use but also influences the intensity of development, contributing to a diverse and varied urban landscape.
