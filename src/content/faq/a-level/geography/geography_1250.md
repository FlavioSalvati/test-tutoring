Migration can profoundly influence age/sex structure diagrams, commonly known as population pyramids, often resulting in imbalances in age and gender distributions.

Population pyramids serve as visual tools to analyze the age and sex distribution of a population. The effects of migration—whether internal or international—on these diagrams can be substantial, frequently leading to noticeable disparities in age and gender distribution.

One of the most prevalent outcomes of migration is the emergence of a "youth bulge." This phenomenon occurs when a significant number of young individuals, typically males, migrate for employment or educational opportunities. As a result, the destination region may experience an excess of young males, while the source region may see a corresponding deficit. In the population pyramid for the destination region, this is represented by a pronounced bulge in the young adult male demographic, whereas the source region's pyramid reflects a dip in the same age group.

Conversely, when a considerable number of older individuals migrate—often in search of retirement opportunities—this can generate a "senior bulge." In this case, the destination region will display a bulge in the older age brackets, while the source region will exhibit a decline in these groups. Such shifts can have significant implications for social services and healthcare systems in both the source and destination regions.

Migration can also result in gender imbalances. For instance, if a greater number of males migrate compared to females, this will lead to a surplus of males in the destination region and a deficit in the source region. This disparity would be evident in the population pyramids, showing a wider male base in the destination region and a narrower male base in the source region.

In summary, migration can dramatically reshape age/sex structure diagrams, creating imbalances in age and gender distributions. These changes carry important implications for social, economic, and health policies in both the source and destination regions.
