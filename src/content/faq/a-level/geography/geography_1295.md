Gender equality significantly impacts population growth and structure by influencing fertility rates, migration patterns, and age demographics.

One of the most notable effects of gender equality is on fertility rates. When women have equal access to education and employment opportunities, they are more likely to postpone marriage and childbirth, which typically results in lower fertility rates. Educated women tend to possess greater knowledge about family planning and reproductive health, and they often prioritize establishing their careers before starting a family. As a consequence, lower fertility rates can decelerate population growth and contribute to an aging population structure.

In addition to fertility, gender equality also affects migration patterns. In societies characterized by gender inequality, women are often compelled to migrate in search of better opportunities. This migration can create gender imbalances in both the areas of origin and destination. For example, if a significant number of women migrate from rural areas to urban centers for employment, the rural regions may experience a surplus of men, while urban areas may see an increased female population. Such shifts can have profound effects on the gender ratio and overall population structure.

Furthermore, gender equality plays a critical role in shaping the age structure of a population. In societies with high levels of gender equality, women generally enjoy longer lifespans due to improved healthcare access and reduced exposure to violence. This results in a higher proportion of older women in the population. Conversely, in societies where gender inequality is prevalent, high maternal mortality rates and violence against women can significantly lower women's life expectancy, thereby impacting the overall age structure.

In summary, gender equality is vital in influencing population growth and structure. It affects essential demographic factors such as fertility rates, migration patterns, and age distribution, all of which contribute to the dynamics of the population as a whole.
