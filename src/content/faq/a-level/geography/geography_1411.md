Population policies around the globe can be categorized into three main types: pro-natalist, anti-natalist, and immigration policies.

Pro-natalist policies are initiatives implemented by governments to promote population growth. Such policies are commonly found in nations experiencing declining birth rates or aging populations. For instance, France has established a variety of family-friendly measures, including generous maternity leave, subsidized childcare, and financial incentives aimed at encouraging families to have more children. Similarly, Singapore has introduced the 'Baby Bonus' scheme, which offers cash gifts and tax benefits to parents of newborns. The primary goal of these policies is to boost birth rates and revitalize the population.

In contrast, anti-natalist policies seek to curtail population growth. These policies are typically enacted in countries grappling with high birth rates or overpopulation challenges. A well-known example of an anti-natalist policy is China's 'One Child Policy,' which was introduced in 1979 to regulate population growth by restricting urban couples to a single child. However, due to the adverse social and economic consequences of this policy, it was replaced in 2016 with a 'Two Child Policy.' Likewise, India has implemented family planning programs and educational campaigns aimed at promoting smaller families and mitigating population growth.

Lastly, immigration policies are utilized by countries to manage the number and types of individuals permitted to enter and reside within their borders. These policies can either increase or decrease population size, depending on the specific needs of the country. For example, Australia employs a points-based immigration system that prioritizes skilled migrants, aiming to enhance economic growth and address the challenges posed by an aging population. Conversely, nations like Japan have instituted stringent immigration policies, reflecting a desire to preserve cultural homogeneity despite experiencing a declining population.

In conclusion, population policies exhibit significant variation worldwide, reflecting the diverse demographic challenges and objectives faced by different countries. Whether pro-natalist, anti-natalist, or focused on immigration, these policies play a vital role in shaping a nation's demographic landscape.
