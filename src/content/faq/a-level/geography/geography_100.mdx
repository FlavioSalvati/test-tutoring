Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is a coordinated approach designed to harmonize various activities and interests within a coastal area, ensuring sustainable utilization of resources.

ICZM is a dynamic, multidisciplinary, and iterative process that brings together government entities, communities, scientific research, and management strategies. Its goal is to develop and implement an integrated plan for the protection and sustainable development of coastal systems and resources. This holistic methodology considers a wide range of factors affecting coastal zones, encompassing both human activities and natural processes.

The ICZM process begins with a thorough assessment of the coastal zone, pinpointing key issues and challenges it faces. These challenges may include erosion, pollution, overfishing, and the impacts of climate change. Following this assessment, a strategy is developed to address these issues, rooted in the principles of sustainable development. The aim is to strike a balance between economic growth and the imperative to protect and preserve the coastal environment.

Once the strategy is established, it is implemented through a variety of measures. These measures may encompass the introduction of new laws and regulations, modifications to planning and development guidelines, or initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable practices among businesses and communities. The effectiveness of these measures is subject to continuous monitoring and evaluation, with adjustments made as necessary to maintain their efficacy.

A fundamental aspect of ICZM is its inclusive nature, engaging a diverse array of stakeholders. This group includes government agencies, local authorities, businesses, community organizations, and individual citizens. Such inclusivity ensures that all interests are considered, and that decision-making occurs in a democratic and transparent manner. Furthermore, this collaborative approach fosters support for the strategy and encourages active participation from all parties in the management of coastal resources.

In summary, ICZM represents a comprehensive and coordinated approach to coastal management, aimed at ensuring sustainable use that benefits all stakeholders involved.
