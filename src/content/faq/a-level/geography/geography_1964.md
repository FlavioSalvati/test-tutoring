Climate change is poised to intensify weathering and erosion processes, thereby altering the morphology of tropical granite and limestone landforms.

Specifically, global warming is anticipated to have profound effects on the physical characteristics of these landforms. An increase in temperature can accelerate chemical weathering processes, particularly in granite formations. Granite, which is primarily composed of quartz, mica, and feldspar, is particularly susceptible to chemical weathering through hydrolysis. As temperatures rise, the rate of hydrolysis increases, resulting in the transformation of granite into clay minerals. This process may lead to significant changes in the physical structure of granite landforms, such as tors and inselbergs, potentially resulting in their gradual degradation over time.

In a similar vein, limestone landforms in tropical regions—characterized by features such as caves, sinkholes, and karst landscapes—are also likely to be significantly impacted by climate change. Limestone is especially vulnerable to chemical weathering via carbonation. Elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a primary contributor to climate change, can result in more acidic rainfall. This acidic precipitation can accelerate the dissolution of limestone—a process known as solution—potentially leading to an increase in both the size and number of karst features.

Moreover, climate change is expected to cause shifts in precipitation patterns, with forecasts indicating a rise in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events. Such changes could enhance the rates of physical weathering and erosion, particularly in granite landforms. Increased rainfall may also lead to greater water infiltration into the ground, which could facilitate the expansion of underground cave systems in limestone landscapes.

In summary, the effects of climate change on tropical granite and limestone landforms are likely to be substantial, potentially resulting in significant alterations to their physical structure and morphology. These changes could have far-reaching implications for the ecosystems supported by these landforms, as well as for human activities such as tourism and agriculture.
