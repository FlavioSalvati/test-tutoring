Global trends reveal a concerning increase in both the frequency and severity of floods, driven by climate change and human activities.

In recent years, the incidence and intensity of floods across the globe have markedly risen. This escalation is primarily linked to climate change, which has resulted in increased rainfall and rising sea levels—both of which significantly contribute to flooding. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has projected that the frequency and severity of floods will continue to rise in the coming years as a consequence of global warming.

Human activities play a crucial role in exacerbating this upward trend in flood occurrences. Urbanization, for example, often leads to the degradation of natural water-absorbing landscapes, such as forests and grasslands, which are frequently replaced by impermeable surfaces like concrete. This transformation diminishes the land's capacity to absorb rainfall, consequently increasing surface runoff and elevating the risk of flooding. Additionally, poor land management practices, including deforestation and inappropriate agricultural techniques, further heighten flood risks by reducing the land’s ability to retain water.

Moreover, the construction of dams and other water management infrastructures, while intended to control flooding, can also inadvertently increase the frequency and severity of floods if these systems are not adequately managed or if they fail.

The rising global trends in flood frequency and severity pose serious concerns, as floods can have devastating effects on communities, economies, and ecosystems. They may result in loss of life and property, displace populations, damage critical infrastructure, and disrupt natural habitats. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend these trends and their underlying causes to develop effective strategies for managing and mitigating the risks associated with flooding.
