Wind and water are both crucial in shaping the landforms found in desert environments; however, their impacts and processes are markedly different.

Wind, through aeolian processes, primarily influences desert landforms via the erosion, transportation, and deposition of sand and dust. Erosion occurs when wind removes and wears away loose particles from the surfaces of rocks. This process can lead to the formation of various landforms, such as yardangs—streamlined ridges sculpted by wind—and deflation hollows, which are depressions formed by the removal of loose material. Furthermore, wind transports these eroded materials, resulting in the creation of sand dunes, which are mounds or ridges of sand deposited by the wind. The shape and size of these dunes are determined by factors such as wind direction, the availability of sand, and the presence of vegetation.

In contrast, water shapes desert landforms through fluvial and pluvial processes. Despite the arid nature of deserts, infrequent but intense rainfall can trigger flash floods that erode and transport substantial amounts of material. This process contributes to the formation of wadis—dry riverbeds that only contain water during heavy rain events—and alluvial fans, which are fan-shaped deposits of materials transported by water. Water also contributes to weathering processes, such as salt weathering, where salts in the soil expand and contract with fluctuations in moisture, leading to the cracking and erosion of rocks.

While both wind and water significantly shape desert landforms, their effects vary based on the desert's climate, vegetation, and geology. Wind processes tend to be more dominant in hyper-arid deserts characterized by sparse vegetation and loose surface materials, whereas water processes are more significant in semi-arid deserts that receive more rainfall and support greater vegetation. Nevertheless, these processes often interact; for instance, wind can redistribute materials that have been eroded and deposited by water, while water influences the distribution and growth of vegetation, which subsequently affects wind erosion and deposition.
