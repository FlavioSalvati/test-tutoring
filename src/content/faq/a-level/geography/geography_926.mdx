The distribution of global precipitation is significantly influenced by several key factors, including latitude, altitude, prevailing winds, and proximity to bodies of water.

Precipitation patterns around the world are primarily shaped by the Earth's atmospheric circulation and the arrangement of land and sea. Near the equator, intense solar heating causes air to rise, resulting in high levels of precipitation and the formation of lush rainforests. This phenomenon is referred to as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). As this rising air moves away from the equator, it cools and descends, creating areas of high pressure that receive little precipitation. This process leads to the development of major desert regions, typically located around $30^\circ$ latitude, such as the Sahara Desert and the Australian Outback.

Altitude plays a crucial role in the distribution of precipitation as well. When air ascends over mountain ranges, it cools and condenses, resulting in precipitation on the windward side of the mountains; this process is known as orographic rainfall. Conversely, the leeward side of the mountain often experiences a rain shadow effect, where the air has lost most of its moisture, leading to significantly drier conditions.

In addition, prevailing winds and ocean currents can greatly influence precipitation patterns. For instance, in coastal regions where the prevailing winds blow from the sea, there is typically an increase in rainfall due to the moisture-laden air from the ocean. This phenomenon is referred to as maritime influence. On the other hand, areas characterized by a continental climate, where the prevailing winds originate from the land, generally receive less precipitation.

Finally, the proximity to bodies of water also affects precipitation levels. Coastal areas tend to experience higher rainfall compared to inland regions, primarily due to the availability of moisture from the ocean. This effect is especially pronounced in locations where warm ocean currents flow close to the coast, as the warm water enhances evaporation and subsequently increases the potential for precipitation.

In conclusion, the global distribution of precipitation results from a complex interplay of various geographical factors, including latitude, altitude, prevailing winds, and proximity to bodies of water.
