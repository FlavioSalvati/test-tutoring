Tropical climates are characterized by two distinct seasons: the wet season and the dry season.

Rainfall patterns in these regions are greatly influenced by the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the presence of monsoons. The ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that encircles the Earth near the equator, where the trade winds from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge. This convergence causes air to rise, leading to cloud formation and precipitation. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the ITCZ shifts north or south, resulting in the alternating wet and dry seasons typical of tropical climates.

During the wet season, the ITCZ is positioned over the region, leading to significant rainfall. This phenomenon occurs because air masses converge, rise, cool, and condense, forming rain clouds. The wet season is marked by heavy and frequent rainfall, often manifesting as afternoon thunderstorms. Depending on the specific tropical location, this wet season can last from a few months to more than half the year.

In contrast, the dry season occurs when the ITCZ shifts away from the region. In the absence of this low-pressure system, cloud formation and precipitation diminish. The weather during this season is generally hot and dry, with little to no rainfall. Similar to the wet season, the duration of the dry season can vary, lasting anywhere from a few months to over half the year.

Monsoons also significantly impact tropical rainfall patterns, especially in regions such as South Asia and West Africa. Monsoons are seasonal wind patterns that bring heavy rainfall. They occur when land heats up more quickly than the ocean, causing the air over the land to rise and draw in moist air from the ocean. This moist air then condenses and falls as rain, resulting in a wet season closely associated with monsoons.

In summary, the seasonal rainfall patterns in tropical climates are primarily driven by the movement of the ITCZ and the occurrence of monsoons, leading to distinct wet and dry seasons.
