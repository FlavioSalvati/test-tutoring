Divergent plate boundaries are regions where tectonic plates are moving apart, resulting in volcanic activity and the process of seafloor spreading.

Also referred to as constructive boundaries, divergent plate boundaries occur when two tectonic plates move away from each other. This movement is driven by convection currents in the Earth's mantle, which cause the lithosphere to crack and separate. The gap created by this divergence is filled with magma from the mantle, which eventually cools and solidifies to form new crust. This phenomenon is known as seafloor spreading and is primarily responsible for the formation of new oceanic crust.

A prominent feature of divergent plate boundaries is the volcanic activity associated with them. As the plates separate, magma rises to occupy the gap, often leading to volcanic eruptions. These eruptions can occur both underwater, resulting in submarine volcanoes and contributing to seafloor spreading, as well as on land, where they can create volcanic mountain ranges. A prime example of this is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a divergent boundary where new crust is continuously being formed, contributing to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean.

Another significant characteristic of divergent plate boundaries is the formation of rift valleys. These valleys occur when the lithosphere fractures and a central section sinks, creating a depression. The East African Rift Valley serves as an excellent example, where the African Plate is splitting into the Somali and Nubian Plates.

Divergent plate boundaries are also associated with high heat flow and geothermal activity. The presence of magma close to the Earth's surface results in a higher-than-average heat flow in these regions. This can lead to the formation of hydrothermal vents in the ocean, as well as geysers and hot springs on land, such as those found in Iceland, which is situated on the divergent boundary between the North American and Eurasian Plates.

In summary, divergent plate boundaries are dynamic regions of the Earth's crust characterized by the movement of tectonic plates, volcanic activity, seafloor spreading, the formation of rift valleys, and significant geothermal activity.
