Tropical storms and rainfall have a profound impact on the development of limestone landforms through various processes of erosion, dissolution, and deposition.

These meteorological phenomena are particularly significant in shaping limestone landscapes, primarily via chemical weathering. Limestone, which is predominantly composed of calcium carbonate ($\text{CaCO}_3$), is highly vulnerable to dissolution under acidic conditions. In tropical regions, rainwater frequently contains dissolved carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) from the atmosphere, rendering it slightly acidic. When this rainwater interacts with limestone, it reacts with the calcium carbonate, resulting in its dissolution. This process, known as carbonation, is fundamental to the formation of limestone landscapes, leading to distinctive features such as sinkholes, caves, and limestone pavements.

Tropical storms, characterized by their heavy and often prolonged rainfall, can significantly accelerate the rate of these processes. The substantial volume of water during such storms enhances the dissolution of limestone, resulting in more pronounced and rapidly evolving landforms. Additionally, the intense rainfall can contribute to physical erosion, breaking down limestone and providing additional materials that are subject to chemical weathering.

Moreover, the runoff generated by these storms plays a crucial role in shaping limestone landforms. As water flows across the surface, it can transport dissolved limestone and sediment, depositing them in new locations. This process, known as deposition, can give rise to new landforms, such as terraces and alluvial fans.

Furthermore, the strong winds associated with tropical storms can lead to the development of aeolian landforms. These features are formed as wind erodes, transports, and deposits materials, often creating dunes or other wind-blown landscapes. In limestone regions, this can result in the formation of characteristics such as yardangs, which are streamlined ridges shaped by wind erosion.

In summary, the effects of tropical storms and rainfall on the development of limestone landforms are complex and multifaceted, involving both chemical and physical processes. The interplay of dissolution, erosion, and deposition contributes to a dynamic and continually evolving landscape.
