The tropical climate is marked by two distinct seasons: the wet season and the dry season. The wet season is characterized by heavy rainfall and high humidity, while the dry season features minimal rainfall and lower humidity levels.

In the tropics, the wet season, often referred to as the rainy season, typically occurs when the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is positioned overhead. This zone is where the trade winds from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge, causing the air to rise, which in turn leads to the formation of clouds and precipitation. During the wet season, regions experience frequent and substantial rainfall, often manifesting as intense thunderstorms in the afternoons. This significant amount of rainfall results in elevated humidity levels, creating a warm and moist climate. Additionally, the wet season fosters the growth of lush vegetation and contributes to the thriving of various insects and other animal species.

Conversely, the dry season in tropical regions occurs when the ITCZ is displaced from overhead. During this period, trade winds predominantly blow from the land to the sea, resulting in reduced cloud formation and decreased rainfall. The dry season is characterized by significantly lower levels of precipitation, which leads to diminished humidity. Consequently, the climate during this time is typically hot and dry, with landscapes becoming quite arid, especially in areas where the dry season is prolonged. This lack of rainfall can lead to water shortages and drought conditions, particularly in regions lacking adequate water storage facilities.

The duration and intensity of the wet and dry seasons can vary significantly across different locations within the tropics. Some areas may experience a relatively balanced distribution between wet and dry seasons, while others may have a pronounced wet season accompanied by a brief dry season, or vice versa. These seasonal variations can profoundly affect local ecosystems, agriculture, and human activities.
