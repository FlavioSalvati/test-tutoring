Carbon emissions play a significant role in global warming by elevating the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

These emissions primarily consist of carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) and methane ($\text{CH}_4$), which are released into the atmosphere through various human activities. Key contributors include the combustion of fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes. These greenhouse gas emissions are critical to the phenomenon of global warming, characterized by a long-term increase in Earth's average temperature.

The connection between carbon emissions and global warming is grounded in the greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases, such as $\text{CO}_2$ and $\text{CH}_4$, can trap heat from the sun in the Earth's atmosphere, preventing it from escaping back into space. This natural process is essential for sustaining life on Earth, as it helps maintain a temperature conducive to life. However, the excessive accumulation of these gases due to human activities amplifies this effect, resulting in an increase in the Earth's average temperatureâ€”a process referred to as global warming.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has recognized $\text{CO}_2$ as the most significant anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Its concentration in the atmosphere has risen dramatically since the Industrial Revolution, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. When fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas are burned for energy, they release $\text{CO}_2$ into the atmosphere. Similarly, when forests are cleared, the carbon stored in trees is released as $\text{CO}_2$.

Although methane is present in smaller quantities compared to $\text{CO}_2$, it is a more potent greenhouse gas. Emissions of methane from human activities, including livestock farming and rice cultivation, also contribute significantly to global warming.

In conclusion, carbon emissions from human activities increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, thereby intensifying the greenhouse effect and leading to global warming. This warming has profound implications for the Earth's climate system, including rising sea levels, shifts in weather patterns, and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.
