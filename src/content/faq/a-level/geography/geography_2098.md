Coastal lagoons are shallow bodies of water located along coastlines, separated from the open ocean by a barrier, which results in limited water exchange with the sea.

These lagoons are distinctive geographical features, typically found along low-lying coastal areas. They are characterized by their shallow depths, with most lagoons measuring less than $10$ meters deep. This shallow environment, along with their isolation from the ocean, fosters a unique ecosystem capable of supporting a diverse array of plant and animal species.

One of the most notable characteristics of coastal lagoons is their varying salinity levels. The salinity of a lagoon can fluctuate significantly based on the influx of freshwater from rivers and rainfall, as well as the degree of connection to the sea. Some lagoons may exhibit hypersaline conditions, with salinity levels exceeding that of seawater, while others may be brackish or even freshwater. These variations in salinity greatly influence the types of organisms that can thrive within the lagoon.

Another crucial attribute of coastal lagoons is their sediment composition. The sediments found in these lagoons are typically fine-grained, composed mainly of silt and clay particles. These sediments may be transported into the lagoon by rivers or deposited by oceanic processes. The specific composition of the sediments can significantly affect the types of vegetation that can grow in the lagoon, as well as the animal species that can inhabit the area.

Furthermore, coastal lagoons are characterized by their dynamic nature. They undergo continuous changes due to processes such as sedimentation, erosion, and fluctuations in sea level. These changes can alter both the shape and size of the lagoon, as well as its connectivity to the ocean. This dynamic aspect makes coastal lagoons a captivating subject for research among geographers and other scientists.
