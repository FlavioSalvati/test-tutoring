Mass movements can lead to both immediate and long-term transformations in landscapes, affecting landforms and ecosystems profoundly.

In the short term, phenomena such as landslides, rockfalls, and mudflows can drastically reshape the terrain. These events may result in the removal of substantial amounts of soil and rock from one location, subsequently depositing them in another. This process can generate new landforms, including landslide scars and debris cones. Additionally, mass movements can disrupt local ecosystems by burying habitats and altering waterways, which can have significant repercussions for local flora and fauna. For instance, a landslide might block a river, creating a temporary lake that floods adjacent areas. This flooding can lead to the demise of plants and animals, thereby disturbing the equilibrium of the local ecosystem.

In the long term, mass movements contribute to the landscape's evolution in meaningful ways. They can facilitate the formation of new geological features, such as terraces and alluvial fans. Over time, the materials deposited by these movements may undergo compaction and lithification, a process in which sediments are transformed into solid rock. This transformation can lead to the development of distinctive geological formations that provide insights into the history of past mass movements.

Moreover, the long-term impacts of mass movements can induce changes in land use. Regions that have experienced significant mass movements may be considered unsafe for human habitation or agricultural practices, prompting shifts in land use patterns. For example, areas that are susceptible to landslides may be designated as parks or transformed into other types of land that do not necessitate permanent structures.

In summary, mass movements can yield both immediate and enduring effects on landscapes. They can bring about dramatic changes in the short term, while over time, they can significantly shape the landscape and influence land use patterns.
