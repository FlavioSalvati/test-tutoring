The Netherlands' Room for the River project stands out as a successful case study in flood hazard management.

With approximately $26\%$ of its land situated below sea level, the Netherlands has developed a robust history of managing flood risks. Launched in $2007$, the Room for the River project exemplifies the country's innovative approach to addressing flood hazards. The primary objective of this initiative was to create more space for rivers, thereby reducing the risk of flooding. This was accomplished through various measures, including lowering floodplains, deepening the summer riverbed, and relocating dykes.

The project encompassed $39$ sub-projects distributed throughout the country, each tailored to meet specific local conditions and requirements. A notable example is found in Nijmegen, where the Waal River was given additional space by moving the dyke $350$ meters inland. This alteration not only mitigated the flooding risk but also facilitated the creation of an ancillary channel and an island within the river, promoting new opportunities for nature and recreation.

Importantly, the Room for the River project extended beyond mere engineering solutions. It involved comprehensive stakeholder engagement, incorporating input from residents, businesses, and environmental groups. This participatory approach ensured that the project was technically sound while also being socially acceptable.

The effectiveness of the project is evident in its success at reducing flood risks. For instance, in Nijmegen, the water level during high flow events is now $34$ cm lower than it would have been without the project's interventions. Additionally, the initiative has yielded numerous benefits, including improved water quality, enhanced biodiversity, and new recreational opportunities.

Ultimately, the Room for the River project illustrates that effective flood hazard management can thrive when it integrates technical solutions with stakeholder engagement, addressing both the immediate needs for flood protection and the long-term goals of sustainable development.
