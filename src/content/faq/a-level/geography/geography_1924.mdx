Caves and sinkholes in limestone regions primarily form through chemical weathering processes known as carbonation and solution.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock that is particularly vulnerable to chemical weathering, especially from these two processes. The process begins when rainwater, which is naturally slightly acidic due to dissolved carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, interacts with the limestone. The carbon dioxide in the rainwater reacts with the calcium carbonate ($\text{CaCO}_3$) present in the limestone, producing calcium bicarbonate ($\text{Ca(HCO}_3)_2$), which is soluble in water. This soluble compound is then carried away by the flowing water, resulting in the gradual erosion of the limestone.

Over time, this erosion can lead to the formation of caves. As water continues to flow and erode the limestone, it can create underground channels. These channels may eventually expand enough to form caves. The development of caves is often facilitated by the existence of joints or faults within the limestone, which provide pathways for the water to flow more easily.

In contrast, sinkholes occur when the roof of a cave collapses. This collapse can happen when the cave becomes too large to support its own weight, or when the water table drops, removing the water that had previously supported the roof. When the roof collapses, it creates a depression or hole at the surface, which is referred to as a sinkhole.

The process of cave and sinkhole formation in limestone regions is gradual, taking thousands to millions of years. It is a natural aspect of the earth's ongoing cycle of erosion and deposition. However, human activities, such as mining or construction, can accelerate this process and lead to the sudden appearance of sinkholes.
