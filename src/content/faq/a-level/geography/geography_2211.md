Sea walls protect the coast by absorbing wave energy, reducing erosion and preventing flooding in coastal areas.

Sea walls are structures built parallel to the coastline, primarily designed to prevent the sea from encroaching on human settlements. They are a form of hard engineering, which refers to the use of physical structures to protect the coast. Sea walls are typically made of concrete, stone, or other robust materials that can withstand the force of the sea.

The primary function of a sea wall is to absorb and reflect the energy of the waves. When a wave hits a sea wall, the energy is dispersed, reducing the wave's erosive power. This helps to prevent the erosion of the coastline, which can lead to the loss of land and property. By reflecting the waves back into the sea, sea walls also help to maintain the shape of the beach, which can be eroded by wave action.

In addition to protecting the coast from erosion, sea walls also play a crucial role in preventing coastal flooding. By providing a physical barrier between the sea and the land, they prevent the sea from inundating low-lying areas during high tides or storm surges. This is particularly important in areas that are prone to flooding, such as coastal towns and cities.

However, it's important to note that while sea walls can be effective in protecting the coast, they can also have negative impacts. For example, they can disrupt natural coastal processes, leading to increased erosion elsewhere along the coast. They can also be visually intrusive and expensive to build and maintain. Therefore, the decision to build a sea wall should be based on a careful analysis of the potential benefits and drawbacks.
