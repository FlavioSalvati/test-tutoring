Diurnal temperature variation in tropical climates is generally minimal due to the consistent amount of sunlight received throughout the year.

In tropical regions, the sun is nearly directly overhead all year long, which results in a steady influx of sunlight and heat each day. Consequently, the diurnal temperature variation—defined as the difference between the daily maximum and minimum temperatures—is relatively small. Typically, the diurnal temperature range in the tropics falls between $10$ to $20$ degrees Celsius, which is significantly less than the variations observed in temperate or polar regions.

Several factors contribute to the limited diurnal temperature variation in tropical climates. Firstly, the high angle of the sun causes sunlight to be concentrated over a smaller surface area, resulting in more intense heating. Secondly, the elevated humidity levels in tropical areas lead to a substantial presence of water vapor in the atmosphere. Water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping heat and preventing it from dissipating into space. This phenomenon results in warmer nights and a reduced temperature drop after sunset.

Additionally, the prevalence of cloud cover in the tropics plays a significant role in further minimizing diurnal temperature variation. During the day, clouds reflect some sunlight, thereby decreasing the amount of heat absorbed. Conversely, at night, clouds act as insulators, trapping heat and thus preventing it from escaping, which leads to warmer nighttime temperatures. This effect further narrows the diurnal temperature range.

In summary, the small diurnal temperature variation observed in tropical climates is primarily due to the consistent sunlight received, coupled with high humidity and significant cloud cover. These factors combine to create a climate characterized by warm days and nights, with little fluctuation in temperature throughout the day.
