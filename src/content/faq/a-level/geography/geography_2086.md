A high-energy coastline is defined by intense wave action, steep gradients, and frequent coastal erosion.

High-energy coastlines are commonly located in regions exposed to strong wave action, which is primarily influenced by prevailing winds and the fetch. The term "fetch" refers to the distance over which the wind blows across the surface of the sea. As the fetch increases and wind intensity rises, the resulting waves become larger and more powerful. These robust waves significantly alter the coastline's shape and features, often resulting in high rates of coastal erosion.

Another key feature of high-energy coastlines is their steep gradient. These coastlines frequently exhibit cliffs and rocky shores, which arise from the strong wave action that erodes the bases of cliffs. This erosion causes the cliffs to become steeper, often leading to landslides and rockfalls.

Additionally, high-energy coastlines are marked by minimal sediment deposition. The vigorous wave action typically transports sediment away from the shore rather than allowing it to accumulate. Consequently, beaches along high-energy coastlines tend to be narrow and composed of coarse materials, such as pebbles and cobbles.

Moreover, biological activity in high-energy coastal environments is often limited due to the harsh conditions. The intense wave action and ongoing erosion create challenges for plants and animals trying to establish themselves. However, the species that do thrive in these conditions are usually specially adapted to survive in such a high-energy environment.

In conclusion, high-energy coastlines are dynamic and perpetually changing landscapes shaped by the formidable forces of wind and waves. They are characterized by powerful wave action, steep gradients, frequent coastal erosion, limited sediment deposition, and reduced biological activity.
