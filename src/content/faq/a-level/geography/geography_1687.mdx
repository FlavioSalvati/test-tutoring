International migration presents several challenges for health systems, including resource strain, cultural barriers, and health inequalities.

One of the most pressing issues is the strain on healthcare resources. A significant influx of migrants into a country can overwhelm the healthcare system, leading to increased demand for services. This heightened demand may result in longer waiting times for treatment, shortages of medications and essential supplies, and added pressure on healthcare professionals. In some instances, the healthcare system may lack the capacity to provide adequate care for all individuals in need, resulting in some migrants not receiving essential medical attention.

Cultural and language barriers represent another formidable challenge. These barriers can hinder migrants' access to healthcare services, impede their understanding of treatment options, and complicate effective communication with healthcare providers. Such obstacles can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and ultimately poor health outcomes. Additionally, cultural differences may influence the types of health services migrants seek and their perceptions of health and illness, further complicating the delivery of effective healthcare.

Health inequalities are a significant concern as well. Migrants often experience poorer health outcomes compared to the native population, driven by factors such as substandard living conditions, limited access to healthcare, and the stress and trauma associated with migration. Addressing these health disparities is challenging, as they are frequently tied to broader social and economic inequalities. Moreover, migrants may encounter discrimination and stigma when seeking healthcare, which can exacerbate existing health inequalities.

Finally, challenges also arise in data collection and monitoring within the health system. Migrants are often underrepresented in health surveys and other data-gathering efforts, making it difficult to accurately assess their health status and needs. This lack of comprehensive data hampers the ability to plan and deliver appropriate healthcare services tailored to the migrant population.
