Advection is the process through which energy is transferred in the atmosphere via the horizontal movement of air masses.

As a fundamental mechanism in atmospheric energy transfer, advection plays a vital role in the distribution of heat and moisture across the planet. This process involves the horizontal displacement of air masses, which carry heat energy from one location to another. It is important to distinguish advection from convection; while advection refers to horizontal movement, convection involves vertical movement of air.

The advection process initiates when air masses with varying temperatures and moisture levels come into contact. Typically, the warmer, less dense air mass rises above the cooler, denser air mass. As the warmer air ascends, it transports heat energy and moisture. This horizontal movement of air masses can occur over extensive distances, effectively redistributing heat and moisture globally.

Advection is particularly significant in influencing weather patterns and climatic conditions. For instance, in the United Kingdom, prevailing westerly winds carry warm, moist air from the Atlantic Ocean towards the land, contributing to the region's mild and wet climate. Similarly, in tropical regions, the advection of warm, moist air from the oceans plays a critical role in the formation and intensification of tropical storms and hurricanes.

Beyond heat and moisture, advection can also transport other atmospheric elements, such as pollutants and dust particles. A notable example is the transport of dust from the Sahara Desert across the Atlantic Ocean, which can impact air quality in the Caribbean and even reach the United States.

In summary, advection is a key process in the transfer of energy within the atmosphere, responsible for the horizontal movement of heat, moisture, and various atmospheric properties. It significantly influences weather patterns and climate, as well as the distribution of pollutants and dust particles.
