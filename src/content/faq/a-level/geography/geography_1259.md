Current global population structures exhibit several noteworthy trends, including an ageing population, increasing urbanisation, and uneven population distribution.

One of the most prominent trends is the ageing of populations, particularly in developed nations. This phenomenon is largely attributed to a combination of rising life expectancy and declining fertility rates. For instance, countries like Japan and Germany are witnessing a substantial increase in the proportion of their populations aged 65 and older. This demographic shift is also beginning to surface in developing countries, signaling a global transition toward older population structures. The implications of this trend are profound, affecting healthcare, social services, and pension systems, as the ratio of the working-age population to retirees diminishes.

Another significant trend is urbanisation, characterized by a growing proportion of the global population residing in urban areas. This movement is driven by various factors, including industrialisation, the pursuit of economic opportunities, and improved access to services. Rapid urbanisation is particularly striking in developing nations, leading to the emergence of mega-cities and extensive urban sprawl. However, this trend is not without challenges; it contributes to issues such as overcrowding, environmental pollution, and increased pressure on infrastructure and public services.

Lastly, there is a marked trend of uneven population distribution, both within and between countries. Certain regions, such as coastal areas and urban centers, are experiencing high population density, while others, especially rural and remote regions, remain sparsely populated. This distribution is influenced by factors such as climate, topography, and economic prospects. On a global scale, population distribution is also unequal, with Asia alone accounting for over $60\%$ of the world's population. Such disparities in distribution have significant implications for resource management, economic development, and environmental sustainability.

In summary, the trends of ageing populations, urbanisation, and uneven population distribution are fundamentally altering global population structures, with considerable social, economic, and environmental consequences.
