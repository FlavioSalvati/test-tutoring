Arid landforms, which are primarily sculpted by wind erosion and deposition, contrast sharply with humid landforms that are predominantly shaped by water erosion and deposition.

The unique characteristics of arid and humid environments give rise to distinctly different landforms due to the varying dominant processes of erosion and deposition. In arid regions, wind serves as the primary agent of these processes, while in humid regions, water takes this role. This fundamental difference in the primary erosional agent results in the development of unique landforms in each type of environment.

In arid environments, the absence of vegetation and the prevalence of loose, dry soil facilitate the movement of particles by wind. This phenomenon, known as deflation, can lead to the formation of desert pavements—surfaces composed of tightly packed stones left behind after finer particles have been eroded away. Additionally, wind can directly erode rock surfaces through a process called abrasion, resulting in features such as yardangs, which are streamlined rock formations, and ventifacts, stones that have been shaped by wind-driven sand. The deposition of wind-blown sand also gives rise to dunes of various shapes and sizes.

Conversely, humid environments are characterized by plentiful rainfall and lush vegetation. In these settings, water erosion can produce a diverse array of landforms. For instance, rivers can carve out V-shaped valleys, create waterfalls, and form meanders. Over time, rivers also deposit sediment, leading to the formation of floodplains and deltas. In mountainous regions, glacial activity can shape the landscape by creating U-shaped valleys and features such as cirques and moraines.

Soil stability in humid environments is generally enhanced by the presence of vegetation and moisture, which mitigates wind erosion. However, the action of water—especially in areas with steep slopes or weak geological formations—can contribute to landslides and other forms of mass movement, further generating distinctive landforms.

In summary, the contrasting primary agents of erosion and deposition in arid and humid environments result in the formation of notably different landforms. In arid regions, the landscape is predominantly shaped by wind, whereas in humid areas, water plays the leading role.
