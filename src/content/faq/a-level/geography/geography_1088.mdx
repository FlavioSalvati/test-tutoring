Thermal expansion is a significant factor in the physical weathering of rocks, caused primarily by fluctuations in temperature.

To elaborate, thermal expansion refers to the phenomenon where a material changes its volume in response to temperature variations. In the realm of physical weathering, this process is predominantly observed in rocks and minerals. During daylight hours, when temperatures rise, rocks absorb heat and expand. Conversely, at night, as temperatures fall, these rocks contract. This continuous cycle of expansion and contraction induces stress within the rock, leading to the formation of cracks and ultimately resulting in the fragmentation of the rock.

Different types of rocks and minerals exhibit varying rates of expansion and contraction due to their distinct thermal expansion coefficients. For example, quartz possesses a lower thermal expansion coefficient compared to feldspar. Consequently, in a rock that contains both minerals, the feldspar will expand more than the quartz. This differential expansion generates additional stress within the rock, which further accelerates its disintegration.

It is essential to recognize that thermal expansion is particularly effective in regions with a substantial diurnal temperature range, such as deserts. In these areas, temperatures can vary dramatically between day and night, causing significant expansion and contraction of the rocks. Over time, this process can lead to the development of geological features such as desert pavements and tors.

In conclusion, thermal expansion plays a crucial role in the process of physical weathering. It entails the expansion and contraction of rocks in response to temperature changes, ultimately contributing to the breakdown of rock structures. This phenomenon is especially pronounced in environments characterized by large diurnal temperature variations.
