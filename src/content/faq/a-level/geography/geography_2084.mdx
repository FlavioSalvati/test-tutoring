Wave-cut platforms are geological features that develop through the erosive action of waves along rocky coastlines over thousands of years.

Also referred to as marine platforms, these structures are characterized by flat or gently sloping rocky surfaces located at the base of sea cliffs. Their formation begins with the development of a wave-cut notch, which is a small indentation at the cliffâ€™s foot created by the powerful forces of breaking waves. As time progresses, this notch deepens and widens due to the relentless impact of waves, particularly during high tides and storm events.

As the wave-cut notch expands, the overhanging portion of the cliff becomes increasingly unstable, ultimately leading to its collapse under its own weight. The resulting rocks and debris are subsequently swept away by wave action, leaving behind a smooth or gently sloping surface known as a wave-cut platform. This cycle of cliff retreat and platform formation continues as long as the sea remains in contact with the cliff face.

The evolution of wave-cut platforms is influenced by several factors. The rate of erosion is contingent upon the strength and frequency of waves, the type of rock present, and the existence of joints and faults within the rock. Generally, harder rocks lead to the formation of narrow, steep platforms, while softer rocks yield wider, more gently sloping surfaces. Additionally, changes in sea level can alter the size and shape of the platform. During periods of lower sea levels, the platform may be exposed to weathering and erosion from wind and rain, further modifying its topography.

Over the course of thousands of years, wave-cut platforms can develop into significant coastal features. They serve as indicators of historical sea levels and provide vital habitats for various marine organisms. Understanding the processes involved in the formation and evolution of wave-cut platforms is essential for effective coastal management, as these features can impact cliff stability and the development of nearby beaches.
