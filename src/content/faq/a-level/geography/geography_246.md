The informal sector faces several significant social and economic challenges, including a lack of legal protection and unstable income.

The informal sector, often referred to as the shadow or underground economy, is characterized by small-scale, self-employed activities. One of the primary social challenges confronting this sector is the absence of legal and social protections. Workers in the informal sector frequently operate outside established legal and regulatory frameworks, which deprives them of the rights and safeguards enjoyed by formal workers. For instance, they typically lack access to minimum wage laws, health and safety regulations, and social security benefits. Consequently, informal workers are often subjected to hazardous working conditions and have no avenues for recourse in cases of injury or mistreatment at work.

Another significant social issue is the lack of recognition and respect for informal work. Many individuals perceive informal jobs as less valuable or legitimate compared to formal employment, which can lead to social stigma and discrimination. This negative perception makes it more challenging for informal workers to access essential services, attract customers, or negotiate fair prices for their goods and services.

From an economic perspective, one of the most pressing challenges is income instability. Informal workers typically do not have a guaranteed income, and their earnings can fluctuate dramatically from day to day. This unpredictability complicates their ability to plan for the future, save money, or invest in their businesses. Additionally, they are more susceptible to economic shocks, such as recessions or natural disasters, which can obliterate their income almost overnight.

Another economic hurdle is the limited access to credit and financial services. Without formal employment contracts or business registrations, many informal workers find it challenging to obtain loans or open bank accounts. This lack of access restricts their ability to expand their businesses or manage financial emergencies effectively. Furthermore, the informal nature of their work often means they lack the necessary documentation to qualify for government support or subsidies, which exacerbates their economic vulnerability.
