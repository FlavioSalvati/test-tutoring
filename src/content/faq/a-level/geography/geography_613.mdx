Extreme weather events can dramatically alter the shape of a hydrograph, leading to rapid increases and decreases in river discharge.

A hydrograph is a visual representation that illustrates the discharge of a river over a specified period. The shape of this graph is influenced by several factors, including the type and intensity of precipitation, the characteristics of the catchment area, and the antecedent conditions. Notably, extreme weather events—such as heavy rainfall or extended droughts—can have a profound effect on the hydrograph's profile.

For example, heavy rainfall can trigger a swift rise in river discharge, resulting in a steep ascending limb on the hydrograph. This occurs because the ground quickly becomes saturated, leading to increased surface runoff and consequently higher river discharge. The peak discharge—the maximum point on the hydrograph—will also be elevated following such intense rainfall. Moreover, if the rainfall ceases abruptly, the falling limb of the hydrograph, which depicts the decline in river discharge after reaching its peak, may also show a steep descent.

Conversely, prolonged drought conditions create a markedly different hydrograph shape. During a drought, river discharge can drop significantly, resulting in a low and flat hydrograph. This decline occurs due to the scarcity of precipitation to replenish the river, compounded by the drying and hardening of the ground, which limits the amount of water that can infiltrate the soil and flow into the river.

Additionally, extreme weather events can influence the lag time of a hydrograph, which is the interval between the peak rainfall and the peak discharge. Heavy rainfall typically reduces lag time, as water quickly flows into the river, while drought conditions can extend lag time, as the water takes longer to penetrate the ground and reach the river.

In summary, extreme weather events can substantially impact the shape of a hydrograph, affecting the rate of rise and fall in river discharge, the peak discharge, and the lag time.
