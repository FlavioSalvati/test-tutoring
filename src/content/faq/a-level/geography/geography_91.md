Beach nourishment is a coastal management strategy that involves adding sand or sediment to eroding beaches, aiming to restore their natural balance and enhance their resilience.

Also referred to as beach replenishment, this technique is employed globally to address the issue of beach erosion. The process entails depositing substantial amounts of sand or sediment onto beaches to counteract erosion and widen the beach area. This approach is particularly important in regions where beaches play a crucial role in the local economy, as it helps preserve the aesthetic value of the shoreline and protects coastal properties and infrastructure.

The beach nourishment process typically begins with the extraction of sand from an offshore location or a nearby sandbank. This sand is then transported and distributed across the eroding beach. The addition of sand not only increases the beach's width but also enhances its slope. This improved slope can effectively absorb wave energy, thereby reducing the rate of future erosion.

However, it is essential to note that beach nourishment is a temporary solution. The newly added sand will eventually erode, necessitating subsequent nourishment efforts. The frequency of these replenishments is influenced by various factors, including wave energy, sea level rise, and the occurrence of storm events.

Environmental considerations are also crucial in this context. The extraction of sand can disrupt marine habitats, and the newly introduced sand may not be compatible with the existing beach ecosystem, potentially impacting local wildlife. Despite these challenges, beach nourishment is often viewed as a more environmentally friendly alternative to hard engineering solutions like seawalls and groynes, which can have more substantial and lasting effects on coastal environments.

In summary, beach nourishment is a widely adopted strategy for managing beach erosion. It offers a temporary solution that helps safeguard coastal properties and infrastructure, maintains the attractiveness of beaches for tourism, and is generally less detrimental to the environment than other coastal management approaches.
