In tropical regions, the temperature decreases with increasing altitude due to the adiabatic process.

This relationship between altitude and temperature is primarily governed by the principles of the adiabatic process, a crucial concept in physics. When air rises in the atmosphere, it encounters lower atmospheric pressure, which causes it to expand. This expansion results in a cooling effect, which explains why temperatures decrease with height. Conversely, when air descends, it is compressed, leading to an increase in temperature.

In tropical areas, the effects of the adiabatic process are particularly pronounced due to the intense solar radiation these regions receive. Strong sunlight warms the ground, which in turn heats the air above it. As this warm air rises, it cools due to the adiabatic process, creating a significant temperature gradient with altitude. This phenomenon is often referred to as the environmental lapse rate, which averages about $6.5\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ for every $1,000 \, \text{m}$ of elevation gained.

It is important to recognize that this is a general trend; actual temperatures can vary due to a variety of factors. Local weather conditions, the time of day, and specific geographical features can all have a significant impact on the temperature at a given altitude. Moreover, the presence of clouds can influence temperatures, as they can reflect sunlight back into space and decrease the amount of heat reaching the ground.

In summary, while the relationship between altitude and temperature in tropical regions is intricate and influenced by numerous factors, the primary mechanism is the adiabatic process. As altitude increases, air pressure decreases, leading to the expansion and cooling of air, which results in lower temperatures at higher elevations.
