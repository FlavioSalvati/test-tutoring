Large-scale atmospheric disturbances, such as cyclones, are characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and low-pressure centers.

Cyclones, commonly referred to as hurricanes or typhoons depending on the region, represent some of the most powerful and destructive meteorological phenomena. These systems develop over warm ocean waters, particularly near the equator. The defining features of cyclones include a low-pressure center, intense winds, and substantial rainfall.

The low-pressure center, often called the "eye" of the cyclone, is a notable aspect of its structure. This area experiences relatively calm weather, with light winds and clear skies, and is surrounded by the cyclone's destructive forces. The diameter of the eye typically ranges from $20$ to $40$ kilometers, with pressure levels significantly lower than those of the surrounding atmosphere. This pressure differential is what fuels the cyclone's fierce winds, which can exceed speeds of $200$ kilometers per hour.

The intense winds associated with cyclones are another crucial characteristic. These winds rotate around the low-pressure center in a counter-clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and in a clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere. This rotation is a consequence of the Coriolis effect, which arises from the Earth's rotation. When cyclones make landfall, the strong winds can inflict considerable damage, uprooting trees and destroying buildings.

Heavy rainfall is also a prominent feature of cyclones. As warm, moist air from the ocean surface rises, it cools and condenses, resulting in cloud formation and precipitation. This process, known as convection, can lead to torrential downpours that often result in severe flooding. The amount of rainfall produced can vary significantly based on the cyclone's size, intensity, and the local topography and climate.

In addition to these primary characteristics, cyclones can generate high waves and storm surges, which pose risks of coastal flooding. They may also spawn tornadoes, particularly upon making landfall. The combination of these features renders cyclones a significant hazard, capable of causing widespread destruction and loss of life.
