International migration significantly influences language distribution by introducing new languages to host countries and reshaping their linguistic landscapes.

When individuals migrate from one country to another, they carry their languages with them, resulting in the introduction of new languages within the host nation. This influx can dramatically increase the number of languages spoken in specific areas, particularly in urban centers where migrants often settle. Over time, these languages can become integral to the linguistic landscape of the host country, thereby enriching its linguistic diversity.

The impact of international migration on language distribution extends beyond merely adding new languages. It can also lead to the decline or even extinction of certain languages. Migrants frequently adopt the language of their new country, especially in subsequent generations. This transition can result in a reduced use of their native language, and in some instances, its complete disappearance. This phenomenon is especially prevalent when the migrant community is small and dispersed, making it challenging to maintain the use of their original language.

Furthermore, international migration can give rise to the creation of new languages or dialects. This occurs when migrants from diverse linguistic backgrounds converge in a new country and develop a unique language or dialect that incorporates elements from their native languages. Such linguistic blending is often observed in multicultural cities where various languages and cultures interact and coexist.

In summary, international migration profoundly affects language distribution. It can introduce new languages, contribute to the decline of existing ones, and even facilitate the emergence of new languages or dialects. Understanding this dynamic process is essential for grasping the intricate and evolving nature of the world's linguistic landscape.
