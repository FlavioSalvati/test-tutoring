The diurnal temperature range (DTR) in urban areas is generally lower than in rural regions, primarily due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect.

To elaborate, the DTR is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures observed over a 24-hour period. In rural settings, this temperature range can be quite pronounced, as there are fewer structures and materials that absorb and retain heat. Conversely, urban areas tend to exhibit a reduced DTR. This reduction is mainly attributed to the UHI effect, a phenomenon in which urban regions are significantly warmer than their rural counterparts.

Several factors contribute to the UHI effect. Firstly, urban environments are characterized by a high density of buildings and impermeable surfaces, which absorb a greater amount of solar radiation during the day and release it gradually at night, thus maintaining elevated temperatures. Secondly, human activities, including heating, cooling, and transportation, further amplify the temperature in urban settings. Lastly, the scarcity of vegetation in cities diminishes the cooling benefits of evapotranspiration.

The diminished DTR in urban areas can lead to several consequences. It may intensify heat-related health issues, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. Additionally, it can increase energy consumption for cooling purposes, resulting in higher greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, this change in temperature dynamics can alter local weather patterns and potentially contribute to more severe heatwaves and storms.

In summary, the variations in diurnal temperature range in urban environments are predominantly influenced by the urban heat island effect. This phenomenon, driven by urbanization and human activities, leads to elevated nighttime temperatures and, consequently, a lower DTR when compared to rural areas.
