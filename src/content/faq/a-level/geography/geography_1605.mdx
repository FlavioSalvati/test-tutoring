Environmental change plays a significant role in shaping international migration by creating conditions that compel or motivate individuals to move across borders.

Changes in the environment—such as climate change, natural disasters, and the degradation of natural resources—can have profound effects on migration patterns. These changes can lead to the emergence of environmental refugees, individuals who are forced to leave their homes due to abrupt or prolonged alterations in their local environment. For example, rising sea levels and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, including hurricanes and droughts, can render certain areas uninhabitable, prompting people to migrate to other countries in search of safer living conditions.

Additionally, environmental changes can exacerbate socio-economic challenges like poverty and food insecurity, further fueling international migration. In regions that heavily rely on agriculture, shifts in rainfall patterns and rising temperatures can result in crop failures, livestock losses, and reduced fish catches. Such outcomes lead to the loss of livelihoods, increased poverty, and heightened food insecurity, driving individuals to seek better opportunities elsewhere.

Environmental changes can also incite conflicts over vital resources, such as water and land, which can further propel international migration. In regions where climate change intensifies water scarcity, tensions may arise between different groups, forcing some individuals to flee their homes and seek refuge in other countries.

It is crucial to recognize that environmental change is often just one of several factors influencing international migration. Other elements, such as political instability, economic opportunities, and social networks, also play significant roles in migration decisions. Consequently, while environmental change can be a driver of migration, it typically interacts with a range of other influencing factors.

Moreover, the relationship between environmental change and international migration is complex and can be shaped by various influences, including government policies, international agreements, and the resilience of individuals and communities. For instance, some individuals may choose to remain in environmentally degraded areas due to strong social ties or a lack of resources to migrate, while others may be compelled to move as a result of governmental actions or limited adaptation options. Thus, understanding the impact of environmental change on international migration necessitates a nuanced and multi-dimensional approach.
