Global political relations play a pivotal role in shaping international migration patterns by influencing policies, treaties, and bilateral agreements.

The political relationships between nations are fundamental in determining the flow of migrants across borders. Countries that maintain strong political ties often establish agreements that facilitate the movement of people. For example, the European Union allows for the free movement of its citizens among member states, a policy that has profoundly affected migration trends within Europe. In a similar vein, bilateral agreements between nations can foster increased migration. The Commonwealth Freedom of Movement Organisation, for instance, proposes the free movement of individuals between the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, which could potentially transform migration patterns among these countries.

On the other hand, strained political relations can result in restrictive migration policies, thereby diminishing the flow of migrants between specific nations. A notable example is the political tensions between the United States and Mexico, which have led to the implementation of stricter border controls, consequently impacting migration from Mexico to the US. Additionally, geopolitical conflicts—such as wars or political instability—can trigger forced migration, generating refugee flows toward neighboring countries or those willing to accept refugees.

Furthermore, global political relations also dictate the characteristics of migration. Countries with amicable relations may experience higher levels of skilled migration, student migration, or family reunification, whereas those with adverse relations may witness an increase in asylum seekers or undocumented migrants. For instance, the 'special relationship' between the US and the UK has facilitated significant levels of skilled and student migration between the two nations.

In summary, global political relations greatly influence international migration patterns through their impact on migration policies and geopolitical stability. Understanding these dynamics is essential for predicting future migration trends and developing effective migration policies.
