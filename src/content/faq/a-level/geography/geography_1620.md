Conflict is a pivotal factor that drives international migration, often compelling individuals to flee their home countries in search of safety.

Conflicts—whether political, social, or military—create an atmosphere of fear, insecurity, and instability. This environment can trigger a mass exodus as people seek refuge in safer regions, resulting in international migration. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), by the end of 2020, approximately $82.4$ million individuals were forcibly displaced worldwide due to persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations, or events that severely disrupt public order.

Migration induced by conflict is typically involuntary; individuals are forced to leave their homes to escape the immediate dangers associated with warfare or violence. This situation contrasts with economic migration, where individuals make the choice to relocate in search of better economic prospects. Conflict often leads to the destruction of infrastructure, loss of livelihoods, and disruption of essential social services, rendering it impossible for people to sustain their lives in their home countries.

Additionally, conflict can result in egregious violations of human rights, including physical and sexual violence, as well as various forms of persecution. Such violations can further drive individuals to seek asylum in other countries, thereby contributing to the phenomenon of international migration. A notable example is the Syrian Civil War, which has triggered one of the largest refugee crises in recent history, with millions of Syrians fleeing to neighboring countries and beyond.

It is essential to recognize that conflict is not the sole driver of international migration. Other factors, such as economic disparities, environmental changes, and social dynamics, also significantly influence migration patterns. Nonetheless, conflict remains a primary cause of forced migration, frequently leading to humanitarian crises and presenting substantial challenges for both the countries of origin and those that receive migrants.
