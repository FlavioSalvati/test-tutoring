Agricultural practices have a substantial effect on above-ground water flows by modifying the landscape, vegetation cover, and soil structure.

Activities such as ploughing, planting, and irrigation can significantly alter the physical characteristics of the land, influencing the movement of water across the surface, a phenomenon known as overland flow. For example, ploughing breaks up the soil, reducing its compaction and enhancing its permeability. This increased permeability allows more water to infiltrate into the soil, thereby decreasing the volume of water that contributes to overland flow. In contrast, soil compaction caused by heavy machinery can hinder infiltration, leading to an increase in surface runoff.

Vegetation plays a vital role in the water cycle, and changes in vegetation cover due to agricultural practices can markedly affect above-ground flows. Unlike natural vegetation, crops typically have shorter root systems and provide less ground cover. This reduction in cover can result in heightened surface runoff, as there is less vegetation available to intercept rainfall and diminished root structure to aid in water infiltration. Additionally, the removal of vegetation for agricultural purposes can expose soil to erosion, which may create gullies and rills that further accelerate the speed and volume of surface runoff.

Irrigation, a prevalent agricultural practice, also influences above-ground flows. Excessive irrigation can result in waterlogging and the creation of surface pools, which may lead to increased evaporation rates. Conversely, implementing efficient irrigation techniques can minimize the volume of water that becomes overland flow, channeling it instead to areas where it is most beneficial for crops.

In summary, agricultural practices can profoundly impact above-ground water flows. They modify the physical characteristics of the land, alter vegetation cover, and affect the quantity and distribution of water on the surface. These changes carry significant implications for the local water cycle and broader hydrological processes.
