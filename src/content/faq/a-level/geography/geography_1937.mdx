Granite and limestone are two distinct types of bedrock that significantly influence the vegetation present in a given region. 

Granite, an igneous rock predominantly composed of quartz and feldspar, tends to weather into acidic soils. These acidic soils are generally low in fertility and can support only a limited variety of plant species. In granite-dominated areas, the most common vegetation includes heather and gorse, both of which thrive in acidic conditions. Other species that may flourish in these environments include bracken and bilberry.

In contrast, limestone is a sedimentary rock primarily made up of calcium carbonate. When weathered, limestone produces alkaline soils that are usually more fertile than their acidic counterparts. These alkaline soils can sustain a broader array of plant species, including various grasses and trees. Limestone regions are often characterized by calcareous grasslands, which exhibit high species diversity. These grasslands can support numerous wildflowers, including orchids and cowslips, along with a variety of grass species. Additionally, woodlands are prevalent in limestone areas, where tree species such as ash and yew are particularly well-adapted to the alkaline conditions.

The differences in vegetation associated with granite and limestone also extend to the animal populations that inhabit these areas. The heather and gorse found in granite regions provide essential habitats for species such as grouse and adders. Conversely, the diverse grasslands and woodlands of limestone areas can support a wider range of fauna, including various birds, butterflies, and mammals. Therefore, the type of bedrock not only dictates the vegetation types in a region but also plays a crucial role in shaping the overall biodiversity of the area.
