Biodiversity plays a vital role in the stability and resilience of granite and limestone ecosystems.

In these ecosystems, biodiversity is essential for maintaining a balanced and healthy environment. They are characterized by unique flora and fauna that have adapted to their specific conditions. The variety of species within these ecosystems enhances their overall health and functionality. For example, different species fulfill various roles—such as producers, consumers, and decomposers—each contributing to nutrient cycling and energy flow.

Granite ecosystems, typically found in mountainous regions, are often nutrient-poor due to the slow weathering of granite. The biodiversity present in these environments, which includes lichens, mosses, and certain tree and shrub species, has evolved to thrive in such harsh conditions. These organisms play a critical role in breaking down granite, thereby releasing nutrients into the soil, which supports a diverse range of plant and animal life.

In contrast, limestone ecosystems are frequently marked by a high degree of endemism, meaning many species found in these areas are unique to them. These ecosystems are often situated in karst landscapes, formed by the dissolution of soluble rocks like limestone. The biodiversity in these regions, which includes various invertebrates, bats, and distinct plant species, enhances the ecosystem's resilience. These species contribute to essential ecological functions such as nutrient cycling, pollination, and pest control.

In both granite and limestone ecosystems, biodiversity also bolsters the ability of these systems to withstand and recover from disturbances, whether they arise from climate change or human activities. Greater biodiversity generally equates to increased ecosystem resilience. A diverse ecosystem is more likely to contain species capable of surviving and adapting to changes, ensuring its continued functionality. Thus, preserving biodiversity in these ecosystems is crucial for their long-term health and survival.
