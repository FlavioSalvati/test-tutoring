Migration significantly contributes to the expansion of shanty towns by increasing population density and the demand for affordable housing.

The movement of individuals, especially from rural to urban areas, serves as a primary catalyst for the growth of shanty towns. Many migrants relocate in search of better economic opportunities; however, they often find themselves unable to afford housing within the city limits. This situation results in the establishment and expansion of shanty towns, as newcomers construct makeshift homes on the outskirts of urban centers.

Rapid urbanization in numerous developing countries has led to a substantial increase in rural-to-urban migration. This trend is frequently driven by factors such as poverty, lack of employment opportunities, and inadequate living conditions in rural regions. As cities present more job prospects, individuals migrate with the hope of improving their living standards. Unfortunately, the high cost of living and scarcity of affordable housing in urban areas often compel these migrants to settle in shanty towns.

Shanty towns, also referred to as slums or informal settlements, are typically characterized by overcrowding, poor sanitation, and a lack of essential services such as clean water and electricity. Despite these challenging living conditions, shanty towns continue to expand, fueled by a steady influx of migrants. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in cities across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, where rapid urbanization and migration contribute to the proliferation of shanty towns.

In summary, migration plays a vital role in the growth of shanty towns by increasing urban population density and the demand for affordable housing. The interplay between this demand and the absence of affordable housing options results in the continued development of shanty towns. As long as rural-to-urban migration persists at its current rate, the expansion of these informal settlements is likely to endure.
