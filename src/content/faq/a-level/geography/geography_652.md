A meandering river channel is distinguished by its sinuous, winding path, deep pools, shallow riffles, and point bars.

A meandering river channel is a specific type of fluvial landform that showcases a serpentine course. This winding pattern arises from the river's ongoing processes of erosion and sediment deposition. The term "meandering" originates from the Menderes River in Turkey, which is renowned for its distinctive winding trajectory.

The meandering pattern becomes more pronounced in the middle and lower courses of a river, where the gradient is less steep. In these areas, the river possesses greater energy for lateral erosion rather than vertical downcutting. As a result, the river erodes the outer banks of its bends while depositing sediment along the inner banks, creating alternating deep pools—often referred to as "pools"—and shallow stretches known as "riffles."

On the outer bend of a meander, where water flow is faster, one typically finds a steep riverbank, commonly called a "river cliff." This area experiences maximum erosion, resulting in the formation of a deep, narrow channel. In contrast, the inner bend, where water flow is slower, features a gently sloping bank known as a "slip-off slope." Here, deposition prevails, leading to the formation of a point bar—a crescent-shaped accumulation of sediment.

The meandering pattern of a river is dynamic and evolves over time due to the continuous processes of erosion and sediment deposition. These processes can result in the creation of new meanders, the migration of existing ones, or the cutoff of meanders, which can give rise to "oxbow lakes."

In summary, a meandering river channel is a complex and dynamic system shaped by the interplay of erosion and deposition. It is characterised by its winding path, deep pools, shallow riffles, and point bars, all of which contribute to the river's unique morphology.
