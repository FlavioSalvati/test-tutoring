Pollution plays a significant role in coral reef degradation by causing disease, bleaching, and reducing growth rates.

Pollution, particularly from land-based sources, is a major contributor to the degradation of coral reefs. This can take the form of sedimentation, nutrient enrichment, chemical pollution, and marine debris. Sedimentation occurs when activities such as deforestation, coastal development, and agriculture increase the amount of sediment in rivers, which is then carried to the ocean. This can smother corals, blocking the sunlight they need for photosynthesis and hindering their ability to feed.

Nutrient enrichment, often from agricultural runoff, can lead to the overgrowth of algae, which competes with corals for space and light. This is particularly damaging in areas where overfishing has removed the herbivorous fish that would normally keep the algae in check. Chemical pollution, including heavy metals and pesticides, can directly harm corals and the marine life they depend on. It can also make corals more susceptible to disease.

Marine debris, such as plastic waste, can physically damage reefs and can also transport invasive species and diseases. In addition, the breakdown of plastic waste can release toxic chemicals into the water.

Another form of pollution that affects coral reefs is thermal pollution, often associated with climate change. This is when the temperature of the ocean increases due to the release of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. Corals are very sensitive to temperature changes and even a small increase can lead to coral bleaching, where the corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn white. If the temperature does not return to normal quickly, the corals can die.

In conclusion, pollution in its various forms plays a significant role in the degradation of coral reefs. It can cause direct harm to the corals and can also create conditions that favour other damaging processes.
