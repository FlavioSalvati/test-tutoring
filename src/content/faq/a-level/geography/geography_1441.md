International migration is primarily driven by four key factors: economic opportunities, political instability, environmental challenges, and social connections.

**Economic Opportunities**  
Economic factors serve as a significant impetus for international migration. Individuals frequently relocate from less developed countries to more developed ones in pursuit of improved job prospects and higher wages, a phenomenon known as economic migration. For instance, many individuals from Eastern Europe migrate to Western Europe seeking better employment options. Likewise, people from developing regions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America often move to countries like the United States, Canada, and various European nations for similar reasons.

**Political Instability**  
Another major cause of international migration is political instability and conflict. Many individuals are compelled to flee their home countries due to war, persecution, or various forms of violence. This type of migration is typically forced rather than voluntary. For example, the ongoing conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and South Sudan have led to millions of refugees seeking asylum in other nations.

**Environmental Factors**  
Environmental issues also significantly contribute to international migration. Natural disasters, climate change, and environmental degradation can render certain areas uninhabitable, forcing populations to relocate. This is referred to as environmental migration. A pertinent example is the rising sea levels caused by climate change, which pose a threat to low-lying island nations such as the Maldives, potentially leading to large-scale migration in the future.

**Social Connections**  
Finally, social connections play a crucial role in influencing international migration patterns. Individuals often migrate to reunite with family members or friends who have previously settled elsewhere. This phenomenon is known as chain migration. For instance, if a person moves from India to the UK for work, it is likely that their family members will eventually follow. Additionally, migrants may choose to settle in regions where they share cultural, linguistic, or historical ties.

In summary, international migration is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by a combination of economic, political, environmental, and social factors. A comprehensive understanding of these causes can enhance our ability to manage and respond effectively to migration flows.
