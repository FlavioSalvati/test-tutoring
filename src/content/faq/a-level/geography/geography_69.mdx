Human activities significantly disrupt nutrient cycling in humid environments through practices such as deforestation, agriculture, and pollution.

One of the most critical ways human actions affect nutrient cycling is through deforestation. When trees are removed, the nutrients that would typically be returned to the soil through processes such as leaf fall and decomposition are lost. This loss can lead to nutrient depletion in the soil, negatively impacting plant growth and the overall health of the ecosystem. Furthermore, deforestation contributes to soil erosion, which exacerbates nutrient loss and further disrupts the nutrient cycle.

Agricultural practices also play a pivotal role in altering nutrient cycling. The application of fertilizers can result in an excess of certain nutrients in the soil, disrupting the natural balance of the nutrient cycle. Over time, this surplus can lead to nutrient pollution, where excess nutrients wash into water bodies, causing issues like algal blooms. Additionally, the method of monoculture—growing a single crop over extensive areas—can deplete specific nutrients from the soil, further interrupting the nutrient cycle.

Pollution, particularly from industrial sources, poses another significant threat to nutrient cycling. Many pollutants can adhere to soil particles, rendering them unavailable for plant uptake. This phenomenon disrupts the nutrient cycle and can result in nutrient deficiencies in the soil. Moreover, air pollution can lead to acid rain, which leaches essential nutrients from the soil, further disturbing the nutrient cycle.

In summary, human activities profoundly impact nutrient cycling in humid environments. These disruptions can destabilize ecosystem balance and lead to a variety of environmental challenges.
