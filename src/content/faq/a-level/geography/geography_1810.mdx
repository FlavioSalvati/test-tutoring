Environmental conditions play a crucial role in shaping the lives of individuals living in shanty towns, influencing their health, livelihoods, and overall quality of life.

Shanty towns, predominantly found in developing countries, are typically characterized by inadequate environmental conditions. These adverse conditions can profoundly affect the lives of their residents. One of the most critical impacts is on health. Factors such as poor sanitation, lack of access to clean water, and overcrowded living environments facilitate the spread of diseases like cholera, typhoid, and tuberculosis. These illnesses can be life-threatening, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly, who often have weaker immune systems.

Additionally, environmental conditions directly influence the livelihoods of shanty town inhabitants. Many residents depend on informal employment for their income, and deteriorating environmental conditions can hinder these opportunities. For instance, if a shanty town is situated near a landfill, some residents may earn a living by scavenging recyclable materials. However, the pollution emanating from the landfill can render this work hazardous, jeopardizing their health and safety.

Moreover, the overall quality of life in shanty towns is severely compromised by environmental conditions. The absence of basic amenities such as electricity, potable water, and adequate sanitation facilities makes everyday living a challenge. Furthermore, shanty towns are frequently located in areas susceptible to natural disasters, including floods and landslides. Such events can devastate homes and displace residents, leaving them homeless and stripped of their belongings.

In summary, the environmental conditions prevalent in shanty towns significantly impact the lives of their residents. These conditions adversely affect health, disrupt livelihoods, and degrade overall quality of life, often rendering daily existence a struggle for survival.
