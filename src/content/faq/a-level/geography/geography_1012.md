Sea-floor spreading is a geological process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and gradually moves away from the ridge. This phenomenon is continuous and plays a vital role in the ongoing renewal and expansion of the ocean floor. The concept was first introduced by American geophysicist Harry Hess in the 1960s and is a fundamental component of the theory of plate tectonics.

The process begins when magma rises from the Earth's mantle to the sea floor at a mid-ocean ridge. Upon reaching the surface, this magma cools and solidifies, forming new crust. As additional magma rises, it pushes the newly formed crust away from the ridge, resulting in the spreading of the sea floor. This movement occurs at a very slow pace, averaging about $2.5$ centimeters per year—approximately the same rate at which human fingernails grow.

As the sea floor spreads, it also carries the continents that rest upon it. This gradual movement explains why continents are slowly drifting apart from one another. For instance, the Atlantic Ocean is widening as the American and Eurasian tectonic plates shift apart.

Additionally, sea-floor spreading is crucial for the recycling of the Earth’s crust. As oceanic crust moves away from the mid-ocean ridge, it cools and becomes denser. Eventually, this denser crust sinks back into the mantle at deep-sea trenches in a process known as subduction. In this process, the crust is melted and recycled into new crust at mid-ocean ridges.

In summary, sea-floor spreading is a fundamental geological process responsible for the formation of new oceanic crust, the movement of continents, and the recycling of the Earth's crust.
