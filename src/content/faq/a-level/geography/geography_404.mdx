The Tourism Life Cycle Model is a framework that illustrates the various stages a tourist destination experiences, ranging from its initial discovery to potential decline or rejuvenation.

Commonly referred to as Butler's Tourism Life Cycle, this model was introduced by Richard W. Butler in $1980$. It encompasses six distinct stages: exploration, involvement, development, consolidation, stagnation, and post-stagnation.

In the **exploration stage**, a destination is discovered by a small number of adventurous tourists. During this phase, local residents have minimal interaction with visitors, and there is limited infrastructure to support tourism.

The **involvement stage** marks a shift as local residents begin to offer basic facilities for tourists. This leads to an increase in visitor numbers, and the area starts to gain recognition as a tourist destination.

As the model progresses to the **development stage**, control over tourism facilities often transitions from local residents to external organizations. At this point, the number of tourists can surpass the local population during peak periods, resulting in rapid growth in both visitor numbers and tourism-related infrastructure.

During the **consolidation stage**, the growth rate of tourist arrivals begins to slow. The destination becomes heavily reliant on tourism, and local residents may experience shifts in their attitudes towards tourists, which can often become negative.

The **stagnation stage** is characterized by the peak number of tourists, leading to challenges such as overcrowding, environmental degradation, and dissatisfaction among both visitors and locals.

Finally, in the **post-stagnation stage**, a destination faces different potential trajectories. It can either rejuvenate by introducing new attractions and experiences or decline as tourists shift their preferences to other locations.

The Tourism Life Cycle Model serves as a valuable tool for understanding the evolution of tourist destinations and the impacts of tourism. However, it is important to note that this model is general in nature and may not apply universally to all destinations, as they can be affected by various factors including political stability, economic conditions, and environmental changes.
