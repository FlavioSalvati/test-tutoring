Island arcs are geological formations that arise from the process of subduction, where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another.

To elaborate, island arcs are commonly found in specific regions of the world where the Earth's tectonic plates interact. Typically located in the ocean, these arcs manifest as a curved chain of islands. The formation process initiates when two tectonic plates collide. In most cases, the denser oceanic plate is subducted beneath the lighter continental plate.

As the oceanic plate descends into the Earth's mantle, it encounters increasing heat and pressure, which causes it to melt. This melting generates magma, which is less dense than the surrounding rock. As a result, the magma rises through the crust, eventually reaching the surface and triggering volcanic activity. Over time, repeated volcanic eruptions deposit layers of volcanic material, which can eventually break the ocean's surface and create islands.

The ongoing subduction and associated volcanic activity along the boundary of the two plates contribute to the formation of a chain of islands, collectively referred to as an island arc. The arcs exhibit a curved shape because the tectonic plates are sections of the Earth's spherical surface, meaning their boundaries are not linear.

Island arcs serve as a compelling illustration of the dynamic nature of our planet's surface. They reveal how the movement of tectonic plates can lead to the emergence of new landforms and how geological processes can shape our world over millions of years.
