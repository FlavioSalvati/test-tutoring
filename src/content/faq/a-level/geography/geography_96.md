The Holderness Coast, located in East Yorkshire, England, serves as a notable case study in coastal management.

Recognized as one of the fastest eroding coastlines in Europe, the Holderness Coast experiences an average annual erosion rate of approximately $2$ meters. This alarming rate has resulted in significant land and property loss, with the village of Great Cowden having completely disappeared due to coastal erosion. In response, local authorities have implemented a variety of coastal management strategies aimed at mitigating erosion and safeguarding the coastline.

A primary strategy employed is the construction of sea defenses. One such defense is rock armor, which involves placing large boulders at the base of the cliffs to absorb wave energy and reduce the impact of erosion. Additionally, groynes have been constructed to trap sediment, helping to build up the beach and providing a natural barrier against wave erosion. These hard engineering approaches have proven effective in protecting critical areas of the coastline, including the town of Withernsea.

In conjunction with hard engineering methods, softer engineering strategies have also been applied. For instance, managed realignment allows certain coastal areas to undergo natural erosion while simultaneously protecting others. This strategy is exemplified at the Spurn Head nature reserve, where natural processes of erosion and deposition are permitted to shape the landscape, fostering a diverse array of habitats for wildlife.

Moreover, local authorities have adopted a policy of "no active intervention" in specific regions. This approach entails allowing the coastline to evolve naturally without implementing measures to prevent erosion, particularly in areas where the cost of protective measures would exceed their benefits.

In summary, the coastal management strategies employed along the Holderness Coast have been largely successful in slowing the erosion rate and protecting vital sections of the coastline. Nonetheless, these strategies also underscore the complexities of coastal management, as they necessitate careful consideration regarding which areas to protect and which should be allowed to erode naturally.
