Maintaining natural slopes in urban environments presents considerable challenges, primarily due to urbanization, erosion, and the impacts of climate change.

Urbanization significantly complicates the preservation of natural slopes. As cities continue to grow, natural landscapes—including slopes—are frequently modified or destroyed to accommodate infrastructure such as buildings and roads. This transformation can destabilize slopes, thereby increasing the risk of landslides and soil erosion. Moreover, the removal of vegetation for construction purposes exacerbates these problems. Plants and trees play a vital role in stabilizing slopes by anchoring the soil with their root systems, and their absence can lead to further destabilization.

Erosion represents another major challenge to maintaining natural slopes. These slopes are vulnerable to both wind and water erosion. In urban settings, the prevalence of impermeable surfaces such as roads and pavements increases runoff, which can accelerate water erosion. This heightened runoff washes away the topsoil, weakening the slope over time. Ultimately, this process can culminate in slope failure, resulting in landslides and other geohazards.

Climate change further complicates the maintenance of natural slopes in urban areas. Increased rainfall and extreme weather events related to climate change can lead to more frequent and severe landslides and erosion. Additionally, rising temperatures may cause permafrost to thaw in colder regions, destabilizing slopes and heightening the risk of landslides.

Finally, a lack of public awareness and understanding regarding the importance of maintaining natural slopes poses a significant challenge. Without public support, local authorities and conservation organizations may struggle to implement effective measures to protect and preserve these critical landscapes. Consequently, education and awareness-raising initiatives are essential components of any strategy aimed at maintaining natural slopes in urban environments.
