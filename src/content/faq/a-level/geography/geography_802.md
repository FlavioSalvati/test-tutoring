Seasonal variations have a significant impact on diurnal solar radiation by altering both the angle and duration of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface.

These variations arise from the tilt of the Earth's axis, which modifies the angle at which sunlight strikes the Earth throughout the year. This axial tilt means that the Earth does not always face the sun directly. Instead, depending on the time of year, it tilts either towards or away from the sun. This tilt is the primary reason for the changing seasons and also affects the amount of solar radiation received at different times of the day, referred to as diurnal solar radiation.

During the summer months, the tilt of the Earth towards the sun results in longer daylight hours and a higher angle of sunlight. In this position, the sun’s rays travel through less atmosphere, which reduces scattering and absorption, ultimately increasing the intensity of solar radiation. On the other hand, in winter, when the Earth tilts away from the sun, daylight hours become shorter and the angle of sunlight decreases. Consequently, the sun’s rays must traverse a greater thickness of atmosphere, leading to increased scattering and absorption, which diminishes the intensity of solar radiation.

Furthermore, the angle of sunlight significantly affects the distribution of solar radiation across the Earth's surface. When the sun is positioned directly overhead, the radiation is concentrated over a smaller area, resulting in higher temperatures. Conversely, when the sun is at a lower angle, the radiation disperses over a larger area, leading to lower temperatures. This phenomenon explains why temperatures are typically higher at the equator—where the sun is often directly overhead—and lower at the poles—where the sun is at a lower angle.

In conclusion, seasonal variations play a crucial role in influencing diurnal solar radiation through changes in the angle and duration of sunlight received on Earth. These variations in solar radiation have profound effects on the Earth's climate and weather patterns and are fundamental to the occurrence of the changing seasons.
