Human-induced changes to land surfaces can significantly alter the shape and timing of hydrographs.

When humans modify the land, the movement of water through the landscape is profoundly affected, as illustrated by the hydrograph. A hydrograph is a graphical representation of the rate of flow (discharge) over time at a specific point in a river or other channel. It can also depict the volume of water in a reservoir.

Urbanization is one of the most common ways humans change land surfaces. This process involves replacing natural vegetation and soil with impermeable materials such as concrete and asphalt. These impermeable surfaces hinder water infiltration into the ground, leading to a more rapid and higher peak discharge on the hydrograph. Consequently, more water runs off the surface and reaches the river in a shorter duration.

Deforestation is another significant alteration. The removal of trees reduces the interception of rainfall by vegetation, allowing more water to reach the ground directly. Additionally, tree roots contribute to the formation of porous soil that can absorb water; thus, their removal can increase surface runoff. This change often results in a steeper rising limb and a higher peak discharge on the hydrograph.

Agricultural practices also influence hydrographs. For instance, ploughing can break up the soil surface, enhancing its capacity to absorb water and potentially reducing surface runoff. However, if the land is compacted due to heavy machinery or overgrazing, it may become less permeable, leading to increased surface runoff and potentially higher peak discharges.

In summary, human-induced alterations to land surfaces can significantly influence hydrographs by modifying the movement of water through the landscape. These changes carry important implications for flood risk and water management strategies.
