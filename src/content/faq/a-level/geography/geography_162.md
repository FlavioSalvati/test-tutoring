A semi-arid climate is characterized by less extreme dryness compared to an arid climate, and it receives more annual rainfall.

Also referred to as a steppe climate, a semi-arid climate typically experiences relatively low annual precipitation, ranging from $250$ to $500$ millimeters. This is in contrast to an arid climate, which receives less than $250$ millimeters of rainfall per year. Semi-arid climates are commonly located at the edges of deserts or in the rain shadow of mountains, where precipitation is limited.

In a semi-arid climate, evaporation often surpasses rainfall, although not to the same degree as in an arid climate. Consequently, while the landscape may be dry and vegetation sparse, the conditions are not as extreme as those found in desert environments. The vegetation in a semi-arid climate usually consists of grasses and shrubs that are specifically adapted to thrive in conditions of limited water availability.

Temperature variations in semi-arid climates can be significant. These regions may experience hot summers and cold winters, or they may have relatively mild temperatures throughout the year, depending on their geographical location. For instance, a semi-arid climate situated in a continental interior, far from the moderating influence of the ocean, is likely to exhibit a greater temperature range than a semi-arid climate located near the coast.

In contrast, an arid climate, often referred to as a desert climate, is marked by extreme dryness. Rainfall is scarce and insufficient to sustain most forms of plant life, resulting in barren landscapes dominated by sand dunes or rocky terrain. Temperatures in arid climates can soar to extreme highs during the day, only to plummet sharply at night due to the lack of moisture in the air, which is unable to retain heat.

In summary, while both semi-arid and arid climates are characterized by low rainfall and high evaporation rates, a semi-arid climate is generally less extreme and can support a more diverse array of life forms.
