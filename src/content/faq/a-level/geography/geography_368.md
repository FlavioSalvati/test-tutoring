Free trade agreements (FTAs) have the potential to stimulate economic growth, but they can also result in job losses and increased income inequality.

FTAs are established to reduce or eliminate barriers to trade, such as tariffs and quotas, among the participating nations. This can foster economic growth by enhancing market access for exporters, promoting competition and efficiency, and attracting foreign direct investment. For instance, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), enacted in 1994, has significantly boosted trade and investment among the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

Moreover, FTAs can lower consumer prices by increasing the supply of goods and services and reducing the costs associated with imports. This increase in supply can enhance purchasing power and elevate living standards, particularly in developing nations. An illustrative example is the European Union's free trade agreements with developing countries, which have played a role in alleviating poverty by facilitating access to more affordable goods and generating employment in export-driven industries.

However, FTAs can also have adverse effects. They may cause job losses in sectors unable to compete with lower-cost imports. For example, the U.S. manufacturing sector has experienced significant job losses due to heightened competition from Mexico and China, particularly following the implementation of NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Such job losses can deepen income inequality, as workers in export-oriented industries typically earn higher wages compared to those in import-competing sectors.

Additionally, FTAs can undermine domestic industries, leading to a decrease in economic diversity. This reliance can render countries more susceptible to economic shocks. For instance, many African nations have become heavily dependent on exporting a limited range of commodities to the EU, making their economies vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.

Lastly, FTAs may contribute to environmental degradation if they spur increased production and consumption without sufficient environmental protections. NAFTA, for example, has faced criticism for exacerbating environmental issues in Mexico, such as deforestation and water pollution, linked to heightened agricultural output.
