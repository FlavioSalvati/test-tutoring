Soil creep is defined as the slow, continuous movement of soil down a slope, driven by the force of gravity.

This phenomenon falls under the category of mass wasting, a geological term that describes the downward movement of rock, soil, and other materials due to gravitational forces. Among the various forms of mass wasting, soil creep is recognized as the slowest, often occurring at a rate of less than $1 \, \text{cm}$ per year. Due to its gradual nature, soil creep can be challenging to detect without specialized measuring equipment.

The process of soil creep typically initiates when the ground becomes saturated with water. This saturation can result from heavy rainfall, melting snow, or other sources of moisture. When the soil is saturated, water fills the voids between soil particles, reducing friction and destabilizing the soil. As a consequence, the soil becomes more vulnerable to gravitational forces.

As the soil gradually shifts downhill, it can create observable changes in the landscape. One notable effect is the leaning of trees and other vegetation, a condition referred to as "pistol-butted" trees. Additional indicators of soil creep include the curvature of soil and rock layers, as well as the gradual displacement of fences, walls, and other structures situated on the slope.

While soil creep is a natural geological process that can occur on any inclined surface, it may be intensified by human activities such as deforestation and construction. These activities can destabilize the soil, thereby increasing the likelihood of soil creep. Understanding and managing soil creep is crucial in areas susceptible to this phenomenon, as it can lead to significant long-term alterations in the landscape and pose risks to human-made structures.
