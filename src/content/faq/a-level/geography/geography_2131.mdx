Beach profiles are influenced by a variety of factors, including wave energy, sediment supply, tidal range, and human intervention.

**Wave Energy**  
Wave energy is a critical factor affecting the shape of a beach. High-energy waves, often generated during storm conditions, can lead to significant erosion, resulting in a steep beach profile. Conversely, low-energy waves, typically seen during calm weather, contribute to the deposition of sediment, creating a gentler slope. The characteristics of the sediment itself also play a vital role; for instance, coarse materials such as pebbles and cobbles tend to form steeper beaches, while finer sediments like sand generally result in flatter beach profiles.

**Sediment Supply**  
The availability of sediment is another essential factor. Beaches that receive a substantial amount of sediment—often from rivers or coastal cliff erosion—tend to have wider and flatter profiles. In contrast, a limited sediment supply can lead to narrower and steeper beach profiles. Additionally, the direction of longshore drift influences sediment distribution, causing accumulation on one side of a headland while eroding the opposite side.

**Tidal Range**  
Tidal range, defined as the difference between high tide and low tide, significantly impacts beach profiles. Beaches with a large tidal range often exhibit complex profiles, featuring well-developed berms—essentially flat areas formed by the deposition of materials at the high tide mark—and a long, gentle slope leading down to the low tide mark. On the other hand, beaches characterized by a small tidal range typically present simpler, more uniformly sloping profiles.

**Human Intervention**  
Lastly, human activities can dramatically alter beach profiles. Coastal management practices such as beach nourishment, which involves adding sediment to the beach, can modify the natural profile. Additionally, hard engineering structures like sea walls and groynes can disrupt natural processes, leading to changes in the beach profile. These interventions can yield both intended and unintended consequences, and their effects may vary over time and across different locations.
