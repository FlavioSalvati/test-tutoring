Wildfires in seasonally humid regions can significantly modify soil characteristics, impacting fertility, structure, and water-holding capacity.

The effects of wildfires on soil in these areas are profound, as the intense heat can induce both immediate and long-lasting changes to the soil's physical and chemical properties. One of the most evident alterations is in soil structure. High temperatures can cause soil particles to fuse, resulting in a rigid, impermeable layer known as a 'fire-induced crust.' This crust can drastically diminish the soil's ability to retain water, leading to increased runoff and heightened erosion.

Regarding soil fertility, wildfires can exert both positive and negative influences on nutrient levels. On the positive side, the combustion of plant material can release essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium into the soil, potentially boosting its fertility. However, in seasonally humid environments, these nutrients are often quickly leached away by rainfall. Conversely, the intense heat can also cause the volatilization of certain nutrients, leading to their loss from the soil. This is particularly true for nitrogen, which is highly prone to volatilization, thereby resulting in a decrease in soil fertility.

Moreover, wildfires can alter the soil biota. The extreme heat can kill beneficial soil organisms, such as earthworms and mycorrhizal fungi, which are vital for nutrient cycling and the formation of soil structure. The loss of these organisms can further amplify the adverse effects of wildfires on both soil fertility and structure.

Additionally, wildfires can change the color of the soil, an important indicator of its properties. The combustion of organic matter often darkens the soil, increasing its ability to absorb heat. This alteration can potentially modify soil temperature regimes, which may subsequently affect biological activity and nutrient availability within the soil.

In summary, wildfires can substantially transform soil characteristics in seasonally humid areas, with significant implications for soil fertility, structure, water-holding capacity, biota, and color.
