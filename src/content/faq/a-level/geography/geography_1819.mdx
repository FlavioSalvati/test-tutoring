Transport infrastructure plays a pivotal role in shaping the locations of urban activities by influencing accessibility, connectivity, and mobility throughout the city.

Key components of transport infrastructure, such as roads, railways, airports, and ports, significantly impact the spatial distribution of activities in urban areas. The accessibility provided by these transport systems determines where businesses, services, and residences are established. Areas with well-developed transport links are typically more attractive for both commercial and residential development, as they offer convenient access for employees, customers, and residents. For example, business districts are often located near major transport hubs, while residential neighborhoods frequently develop along established transport routes.

Additionally, the connectivity facilitated by transport infrastructure is essential for the movement of goods, services, and people, which is crucial for the vitality of urban economies. Efficient transport networks allow businesses to access broader markets, connect with suppliers, and attract a larger workforce. This often results in the clustering of economic activities in well-connected areas, leading to the emergence of urban centers and development corridors. A notable example of this phenomenon is the London Underground, which has profoundly influenced the city's economic geography. Areas served by the tube network tend to experience higher levels of economic activity.

Transport infrastructure also impacts mobility within the city, directly affecting people's daily travel patterns and lifestyle choices. The ease and speed of commuting influence where individuals choose to live, work, and spend their leisure time. Conversely, areas with inadequate transport links may witness lower levels of activity, as they become less accessible and appealing to both residents and businesses. On the other hand, enhancements in transport infrastructure can stimulate urban regeneration, attracting new activities and revitalizing underdeveloped regions.

In summary, transport infrastructure is a critical determinant of urban activity locations. It significantly shapes the spatial distribution of economic and social activities in cities, influencing patterns of development, land use, and overall urban form.
