International agreements play a pivotal role in shaping migration management by establishing essential rules, standards, and frameworks for cooperation among nations.

These agreements can be classified as either bilateral, involving two countries, or multilateral, involving multiple nations. They address a broad spectrum of issues related to migration, including the rights of migrants, the responsibilities of both sending and receiving countries, as well as the procedures for processing refugees and asylum seekers.

A notable example is the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, which are foundational international agreements outlining the rights of refugees and the obligations of states to safeguard these rights. These conventions have significantly impacted how nations manage the influx of refugees and asylum seekers, ensuring that they are treated with dignity and respect.

Additionally, international agreements promote collaboration among countries in managing migration effectively. Through these frameworks, nations can exchange information, coordinate their efforts, and collaboratively address shared challenges. For instance, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, adopted by the United Nations in 2018, emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in migration management. It encourages dialogue and partnerships among countries to enhance the safety and benefits of migration for all parties involved.

Furthermore, international agreements often set specific targets and benchmarks for countries to strive toward. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for instance, include several migration-related objectives, such as reducing the costs associated with remittance transfers and ensuring safe and responsible migration and mobility. These targets provide clear guidance for countries in managing migration and hold them accountable for their progress.

In summary, international agreements greatly influence migration management by establishing the necessary rules and standards, fostering cooperation among nations, and providing clear targets for achievement.
