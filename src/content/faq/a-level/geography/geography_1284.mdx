During demographic transition, birth rates initially remain high while death rates decline, followed by a subsequent decrease in birth rates.

The demographic transition model is a framework utilized by geographers to illustrate the changes in a society's population over time. This model is divided into four distinct stages, each characterized by specific patterns of birth and death rates.

In the first stage, both birth and death rates are high, resulting in a relatively stable population. This stage is commonly observed in less developed countries where access to medical facilities is limited and the use of birth control is not widespread.

The second stage is characterized by a rapid decline in death rates, driven by advancements in healthcare and sanitation, while birth rates remain high. This combination leads to significant population growth. This stage often coincides with the onset of industrialization, which brings about improved living conditions and healthcare, contributing to increased life expectancy.

In the third stage, birth rates begin to decrease as families opt for fewer children. This decline is typically influenced by shifts in societal values and greater access to contraception. Although the population continues to grow, it does so at a slower rate compared to the previous stage.

The fourth and final stage features low birth and death rates, resulting in a stable population once again. This stage is characteristic of more developed countries where both healthcare services and birth control are widely accessible.

In summary, the demographic transition model illustrates that as a society evolves, both birth and death rates tend to decline. However, the timing and pace of these changes can vary significantly across different societies. Understanding this model is crucial for predicting future population trends and preparing for the associated challenges and opportunities.
