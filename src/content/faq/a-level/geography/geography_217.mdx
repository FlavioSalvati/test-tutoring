Subsistence farming systems are defined by small-scale production, reliance on manual labor, and a primary focus on self-sufficiency.

Also referred to as subsistence agriculture, this farming approach prioritizes cultivating enough food to sustain the farmer and their family, with minimal or no surplus available for sale or trade. Typically, these farms occupy just a few acres and serve as the main source of livelihood for the farmer.

A key feature of subsistence farming is the reliance on manual labor. Given the small size of these farms and often limited access to modern agricultural machinery, most tasks are performed by hand or with the assistance of animals. This encompasses essential activities such as planting, weeding, and harvesting.

Another distinguishing characteristic of subsistence farming is the diversity of crops cultivated. Rather than concentrating on a single cash crop, subsistence farmers tend to grow a wide array of crops to satisfy their family's nutritional requirements. This may include grains, vegetables, fruits, and occasionally livestock.

Furthermore, subsistence farming systems generally have a low dependence on external inputs, such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. This reduced reliance is often attributed to financial limitations and a commitment to traditional agricultural practices. Instead, subsistence farmers frequently use natural fertilizers, such as animal manure and crop residues, to enhance soil fertility.

Lastly, subsistence farming is typically influenced by local environmental conditions and cultural traditions. The choice of crops, farming techniques, and the timing of planting and harvesting are often shaped by the local climate, soil characteristics, and cultural customs. Consequently, subsistence farming systems can exhibit significant variability from one region to another.
