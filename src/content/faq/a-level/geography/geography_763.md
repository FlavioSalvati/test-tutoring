Albedo is a metric that quantifies the reflectivity of a surface, indicating the fraction of sunlight that is reflected back into space.

In greater detail, albedo is a fundamental concept in both physical geography and climatology. The term is derived from the Latin word 'albus', which means white, and is typically expressed as a percentage. A surface with an albedo of $100\%$ reflects all incoming sunlight, whereas a surface with an albedo of $0\%$ absorbs all sunlight. Various surfaces on Earth exhibit different albedo values. For instance, fresh snow possesses a high albedo, reflecting up to $90\%$ of sunlight, while dark ocean waters have a low albedo, reflecting only about $6\%$ of sunlight.

Albedo significantly influences Earth's energy balance and climate. The amount of sunlight reflected by a surface affects its temperature as well as the temperature of the surrounding air. High-albedo surfaces, such as snow and ice, remain cooler because they reflect the majority of the sun's energy back into space. Conversely, low-albedo surfaces, like forests and oceans, absorb more sunlight and consequently become warmer. This differential absorption can lead to local and regional climate variations.

In addition, albedo plays a crucial role in climate change. As global temperatures rise, ice and snow melt, leading to a reduction in Earth's overall albedo, which results in increased absorption of sunlight. This process further elevates temperatures through a positive feedback loop known as the ice-albedo feedback. Therefore, understanding and monitoring albedo is essential for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change.

In summary, albedo is a key concept for comprehending how solar energy is distributed across Earth's surface and how this distribution affects our climate. It is a critical factor in numerous natural processes as well as in human-induced changes to our planet.
