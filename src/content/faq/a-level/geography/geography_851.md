The tilt of the Earth significantly influences the distribution of seasonal energy by causing variations in both the intensity and duration of sunlight throughout the year.

The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of approximately $23.5$ degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun. This tilt, combined with the Earth's elliptical orbit, leads to different regions of the Earth receiving varying amounts of sunlight at distinct times of the year. This phenomenon is the primary driver of our seasons.

During the summer solstice, the North Pole is tilted toward the Sun, resulting in longer daylight hours and more direct sunlight for the Northern Hemisphere. This increase in sunlight intensity and duration leads to higher temperatures, marking the arrival of summer. In contrast, during this period, the South Pole is tilted away from the Sun, which results in shorter daylight hours and less direct sunlight for the Southern Hemisphere, indicating the onset of winter.

Halfway between the solstices, during the equinoxes, the tilt of the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the Sun's rays. At this point, the Sun's rays are distributed evenly across the Earth, leading to approximately equal lengths of day and night globally. This alignment signifies the transition between seasons.

Additionally, the tilt of the Earth's axis affects the angle at which sunlight strikes the Earth, known as the angle of incidence. When the Sun is directly overhead, its rays are concentrated over a smaller area, allowing for greater energy absorption. Conversely, when the Sun is positioned lower in the sky, its rays are dispersed over a larger area, resulting in reduced energy absorption. This variation in the angle of incidence further contributes to seasonal temperature changes.

In summary, the tilt of the Earth's axis leads to fluctuations in the intensity and duration of sunlight received by various parts of the world at different times of the year. This uneven distribution of solar energy is what drives the seasons and the accompanying changes in weather and climate.
