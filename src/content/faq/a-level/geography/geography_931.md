The enhanced greenhouse effect amplifies global warming by intensifying the retention of heat within the Earth's atmosphere.

The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon in which certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun, preventing it from escaping back into space. This process is vital for life on Earth, as it maintains a temperature suitable for sustaining life. However, human activities—especially the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation—have significantly increased the concentration of these greenhouse gases, resulting in an enhanced greenhouse effect.

The primary greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), methane ($CH_4$), and nitrous oxide ($N_2O$). When we combust fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy, we release substantial amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Deforestation further exacerbates carbon dioxide levels, as trees that naturally absorb $CO_2$ are removed and often burned, releasing stored carbon back into the atmosphere. Methane is emitted during the production and transportation of coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as from livestock and various agricultural practices. Nitrous oxide is released through agricultural and industrial activities, as well as during the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass.

The enhanced greenhouse effect results in increased heat retention in the atmosphere. This additional heat contributes to a rise in the Earth's average temperature, a phenomenon referred to as global warming. Global warming triggers climate change, leading to more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and alterations in wildlife habitats and migration patterns.

In conclusion, the enhanced greenhouse effect significantly contributes to global warming by increasing the amount of heat retained in the Earth's atmosphere due to the elevated concentration of greenhouse gases from human activities. This, in turn, results in a rise in the Earth's average temperature, leading to a range of environmental consequences.
