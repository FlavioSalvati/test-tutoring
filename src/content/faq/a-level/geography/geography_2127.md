Beaches and sand dunes are created through the deposition of sand by wind and water, followed by their reshaping by these natural forces.

Beaches are formed through a process known as deposition, in which waves transport sand and other materials onto the shore. This process is influenced by several factors, including the strength and direction of the waves, the slope of the land, and the type and quantity of sediment available. When waves break upon the shore, they lose energy, causing them to deposit the sediment they carry. Over time, this accumulated sediment leads to the formation of a beach. The size and shape of a beach can vary over time due to fluctuations in wave energy and sediment supply.

In contrast, sand dunes are formed primarily by the action of the wind. When wind blows across a beach, it can lift and transport sand particles. When the wind slows down or encounters an obstacle—such as vegetation or rocks—it deposits the sand. Over time, these deposited sand particles accumulate to create a sand dune. The shape and size of a sand dune can change over time, influenced by variations in wind direction and speed, as well as the availability of sand.

The formation of both beaches and sand dunes is a dynamic process, shaped by a variety of factors. For instance, the presence of vegetation can stabilize sand dunes by reducing wind speed and trapping sand, while human activities—such as construction and tourism—can disrupt the natural processes that create and shape these coastal features. Understanding these processes is crucial for effective management and conservation of our coastal environments.
