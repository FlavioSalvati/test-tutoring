The types of sediment deposited along coastlines are influenced by several factors, including wave energy, coastal topography, and the sources of the sediment.

Wave energy is a crucial determinant of the sediment type found on coasts. High-energy waves have the capability to transport and deposit larger, heavier sediments, such as pebbles and boulders. In contrast, low-energy waves are limited to carrying and depositing finer sediments, including sand and silt. The size and weight of sediment particles are directly proportional to the energy of the waves. Consequently, coastlines exposed to high-energy waves, like those found in the open ocean, typically feature coarser sediments. Conversely, more sheltered coastal areas with lower energy waves tend to accumulate finer sediments.

Coastal topography, which refers to the physical shape and features of the coastline, also significantly affects sediment deposition. Steeper coastlines characterized by high cliffs often yield coarser sediments, as the erosion of the cliffs results in the deposition of large rocks and boulders onto the beach. On the other hand, flatter coastlines with gentle slopes are more likely to have finer sediments, as the slow and gradual erosion of the land generates smaller particle sizes.

Another important factor is the source of the sediment. Sediment can originate from various sources, including rivers, coastal erosion, and offshore marine deposits. Rivers commonly transport fine sediments such as silt and clay, which are deposited at their mouths, forming features like deltas and estuaries. Coastal erosion can produce a diverse range of sediment types, from fine sand to large boulders, depending on the geological characteristics of the coast. Additionally, offshore marine deposits, which are carried to the coast by waves and currents, contribute to the sediment found along coastlines.

In summary, the sediment type found on a coastline results from a complex interplay between wave energy, coastal topography, and sediment sources. Understanding these factors is essential for predicting and managing future changes to our coastlines.
