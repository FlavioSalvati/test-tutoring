The dynamics of stepped migration are shaped by a variety of push and pull factors, which are typically categorized as economic, social, political, or environmental influences that affect individuals' decisions to relocate.

Stepped migration is defined as the process by which individuals or families transition from smaller towns or rural areas to larger urban centers in a series of stages, rather than making a single, abrupt move. This type of migration is often motivated by a blend of push and pull factors.

**Push Factors** are the adverse conditions that compel individuals to leave their current location. In the context of stepped migration, these may include limited job opportunities, low wages, insufficient educational facilities, political instability, or environmental issues such as droughts or natural disasters in their hometowns or villages. For instance, a farmer might choose to relocate to a small town due to diminishing agricultural prospects in his village, exacerbated by changing weather patterns.

Conversely, **Pull Factors** refer to the appealing attributes or advantages that draw individuals to a new location. These can encompass better job opportunities, higher wages, improved educational facilities, political stability, or a more favorable living environment in the destination city or town. For example, the same farmer may be enticed to move to a small town because it offers a vibrant market where he can effectively sell his produce.

In the process of stepped migration, push and pull factors often interact synergistically. The push factors render the current location less desirable, while the pull factors enhance the attractiveness of the potential new location. However, the decision to migrate is frequently complex and can be influenced by a multitude of additional factors, including personal circumstances, familial connections, and cultural considerations. For instance, the farmer might choose to move to a larger city after residing in the small town for a few years in order to provide his children with access to superior educational opportunities.

In summary, grasping the interplay of push and pull factors in stepped migration is essential for understanding why individuals opt to migrate in stages rather than making a single move. This comprehension also sheds light on the broader patterns of migration that emerge as a result of these influencing factors.
