Depositional and erosional landforms are two distinct categories of geographical features, each formed through unique geological processes.

**Depositional Landforms**  
As the name suggests, depositional landforms are formed by the accumulation of material, typically sediments or rock particles, which are deposited in a new location. This deposition is primarily facilitated by natural agents such as water, wind, or ice, which transport materials from one area and deposit them elsewhere. Examples of depositional landforms include:

- Beaches
- Deltas
- Sand dunes

These features are characterized by the addition of material to the landscape, resulting in growth or expansion.

**Erosional Landforms**  
In contrast, erosional landforms arise from the process of erosion, which entails the wearing away or removal of material from the Earth's surface. This process is also driven by natural forces such as water, wind, and ice, which work to break down rocks and soils, transporting the eroded material away. Over time, this erosion can lead to the creation of distinctive landforms, including:

- Valleys
- Canyons
- Cliffs

Erosional landforms are defined by the removal of material, leading to a gradual reduction or wearing away of these features.

**Key Differences**  
The primary distinction between depositional and erosional landforms lies in the direction of material movement. Depositional landforms result in material being added to the landscape, whereas erosional landforms involve the removal of material. 

Understanding the differences between these two types of landforms is essential for the study of physical geography. This knowledge provides valuable insights into the dynamic processes that shape the Earth's surface. By examining these processes, geographers can develop a deeper understanding of the natural environment and the forces that influence its development.
