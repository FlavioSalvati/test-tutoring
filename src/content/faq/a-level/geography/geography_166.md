The global distribution of hot arid and semi-arid climates is significantly influenced by several factors, including latitude, ocean currents, wind patterns, and topography.

Hot arid and semi-arid climates are predominantly located in subtropical high-pressure zones, which are situated at approximately $30^\circ$ latitude in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. These regions are characterized by descending air masses that are both warm and dry, resulting in low precipitation and high evaporation rates. Notable examples of areas within these zones include the Sahara, Arabian, and Kalahari deserts.

Ocean currents also play a crucial role in shaping the distribution of these climates. Cold ocean currents, such as the Benguela Current off the west coast of Southern Africa and the Humboldt Current off the west coast of South America, contribute to the formation of coastal deserts. These currents cool the air above them, reducing its moisture-holding capacity and ultimately leading to the development of deserts like the Namib and Atacama.

Wind patterns, particularly the trade winds, further influence the prevalence of hot arid and semi-arid climates. These winds originate from the subtropical high-pressure zones and blow toward the equator, typically carrying little moisture as they have already lost it while traversing the oceans. This characteristic significantly diminishes the likelihood of rainfall in the regions affected by these winds.

Lastly, topography can foster the creation of arid and semi-arid climates through a phenomenon known as the rain shadow effect. This occurs when moist air is compelled to ascend over a mountain range, cooling and precipitating moisture as rain on the windward side. By the time the air descends on the leeward side, it becomes dry and warm, resulting in a desert-like environment. An illustrative example of this effect is the Great Basin Desert in the United States, which is situated in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
