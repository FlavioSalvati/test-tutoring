Snow cover plays a crucial role in enhancing diurnal albedo values, which increases the reflectivity of sunlight back into the atmosphere during daylight hours.

Albedo is defined as the measure of a surface's reflectivity, with values ranging from $0$ (indicating no reflection) to $1$ (indicating total reflection). Snow, characterized by its white color, typically has a high albedo, usually between $0.8$ and $0.9$. This means that snow reflects approximately $80\%$ to $90\%$ of the sunlight that strikes it, in stark contrast to darker surfaces such as forests or soil, which tend to have significantly lower albedo values and therefore absorb more sunlight.

The effect of snow cover on diurnal albedo values is particularly pronounced due to the contrast between daytime and nighttime. During the day, when sunlight is present, a snow-covered surface reflects a substantial amount of solar energy, resulting in a high albedo value. Conversely, at night, the absence of sunlight leads to a decrease in the albedo value. This diurnal variation in albedo is a critical factor in the energy balance of the Earth's surface.

Additionally, the presence of snow cover can significantly influence local and regional climates. By reflecting sunlight, snow cover helps to cool the surface and lower air temperatures. This cooling can initiate a positive feedback loop: lower temperatures can lead to increased snowfall, which enhances albedo and results in even cooler temperatures. This phenomenon is referred to as the snow-albedo feedback.

In summary, snow cover has a substantial impact on diurnal albedo values by reflecting a considerable amount of sunlight during the day, thereby contributing to the cooling of the Earth's surface. Understanding this dynamic is essential for comprehending the broader implications for climate and weather patterns.
