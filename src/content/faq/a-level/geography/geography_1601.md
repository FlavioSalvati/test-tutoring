International migration can be classified into four main categories: permanent, temporary, forced, and irregular migration.

**Permanent Migration**  
Permanent migration occurs when individuals or families relocate to another country with the intention of residing there indefinitely. This often happens for various reasons, including the pursuit of employment opportunities, the desire for improved living conditions, or the need to reunite with family members who have already settled abroad. Permanent migrants typically enjoy the right to work, access to public services, and the possibility of applying for citizenship in their host country.

**Temporary Migration**  
Also referred to as circular migration, temporary migration involves individuals moving to another country for a specific, limited duration. This type of migration commonly occurs for purposes such as seasonal work, education, or fixed-term contracts. Temporary migrants generally return to their home countries upon the conclusion of their migration-related activities. This form of migration is especially prevalent in sectors like agriculture, where labor is required during specific seasons.

**Forced Migration**  
Forced migration occurs when individuals or groups are compelled to leave their homes due to factors such as conflict, natural disasters, or other life-threatening circumstances. This category includes refugees who flee their home countries to escape persecution or war, as well as internally displaced persons who are forced to relocate within their own nations. Forced migrants often encounter significant challenges in their host countries, including legal obstacles to employment and difficulties in social integration.

**Irregular Migration**  
Irregular migration refers to movement that occurs outside the established legal frameworks of the sending, transit, and receiving countries. This includes undocumented or illegal migration, whereby individuals enter or remain in a country without the necessary authorization or documentation. Irregular migrants frequently face heightened vulnerability to exploitation and have limited access to public services and legal protections.

Each type of international migration arises from distinct causes and has varying impacts and policy implications. Understanding these differences is essential for developing effective migration policies and addressing the complex challenges and opportunities that migration presents.
