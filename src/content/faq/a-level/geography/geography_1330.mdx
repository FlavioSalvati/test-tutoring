The demographic transition significantly influences housing and urban planning by affecting population growth, density, and the demand for various types of housing.

The demographic transition model outlines the evolution of a country's population over time, divided into four distinct stages: 

1. **High Birth and Death Rates:** Characteristic of pre-industrial societies.
2. **Declining Death Rates:** Seen in urbanizing and industrializing societies.
3. **Declining Birth Rates:** Typical of mature industrial societies.
4. **Low Birth and Death Rates:** Found in post-industrial societies.

Each stage brings unique implications for housing and urban planning.

In the first stage, rural settlements dominate, and the housing needs are relatively straightforward. As a country transitions to the second stage, urbanization accelerates due to industrialization. This shift results in rapid population growth and increased demand for housing, often leading to overcrowded conditions and the emergence of slums. Effective urban planning becomes essential at this phase to manage population distribution and ensure adequate infrastructure.

During the third stage, a decline in the birth rate leads to slower population growth. While the demand for housing persists, the emphasis shifts towards enhancing living conditions and improving housing quality. Urban planning in this stage often focuses on redevelopment initiatives aimed at replacing slums with superior housing options.

In the final stage, the population stabilizes or may even begin to decline. The demand for housing evolves, reflecting a greater need for smaller households due to an aging population and a trend towards smaller family sizes. Urban planning must adapt to these changes, potentially incorporating more retirement homes and smaller residential units.

In conclusion, the demographic transition has a profound impact on housing and urban planning. The variations in population size, growth rate, and composition throughout the different stages of demographic transition create diverse demands for housing and shape the priorities of urban planning. Understanding these dynamics is essential for formulating effective housing policies and urban strategies.
