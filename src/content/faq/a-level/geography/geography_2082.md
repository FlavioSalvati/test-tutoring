Tides significantly influence coastal erosion and deposition by continuously moving and redistributing sediment along the shoreline.

Tides refer to the regular rise and fall of sea levels, a phenomenon driven by the combined gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun, alongside the Earthâ€™s rotation. This ongoing movement of water profoundly impacts the coastal landscape, particularly concerning erosion and deposition processes.

**Erosion** is the process through which land is worn away. During high tide, the elevated water levels can reach the bases of cliffs, dunes, and other coastal features, leading to their erosion. The force of the water can break down rocks and other materials, gradually reshaping the coastline. This effect is especially pronounced in regions with strong tidal currents or vigorous wave action, where the relentless movement of water can significantly alter the landscape over time.

In contrast, **deposition** is the process by which sediment is laid down or accumulated on a landform. During low tide, as the water level recedes, portions of the seabed become exposed. Sediment carried by the water can then settle in these areas. Over time, this process can result in the formation of new landforms such as beaches, sandbars, or mudflats.

The equilibrium between erosion and deposition can be affected by various factors, including tidal strength, sediment type, and the coastline's configuration. For instance, in areas where tides are strong and sediment is easily eroded, erosion may prevail. Conversely, in regions with weaker tides and an abundant supply of sediment, deposition may dominate.

In summary, tides play a vital role in shaping our coastlines. By continuously moving and redistributing sediment, they contribute to the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of coastal environments.
