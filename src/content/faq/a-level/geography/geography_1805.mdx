Suburbanisation is primarily driven by population growth and urban sprawl, resulting in significant changes to urban structures, particularly decentralisation.

Suburbanisation is the process where individuals move from densely populated urban areas to suburban regions. This migration is often influenced by several factors, including population growth, enhanced transportation infrastructure, and the pursuit of more spacious living environments alongside improved quality of life. The relocation of residents and businesses from city centres to suburban locales leads to a transformation in urban structure, a phenomenon known as decentralisation.

One of the primary catalysts for suburbanisation is population growth. As urban areas become increasingly overcrowded, individuals seek larger living spaces and improved conditions, prompting them to relocate to the suburbs. This shift is frequently supported by advancements in transportation systems, which facilitate easier and more convenient commuting from suburban regions to city centres. Additionally, the establishment of new housing developments and commercial spaces in suburban areas further attracts both people and businesses away from the urban core.

The impact of suburbanisation on urban structures is profound. The most prominent consequence is the decentralisation of urban environments. As both residents and businesses migrate to suburban regions, city centres may experience a decline in population and vibrancy. This shift can adversely affect economic activity in urban cores, as businesses often relocate to follow their customer bases to the suburbs.

Furthermore, suburbanisation can foster the emergence of "edge cities," which are essentially self-sufficient suburban communities featuring their own commercial and residential facilities. This trend exacerbates decentralisation, as residents may no longer need to commute to city centres for employment or shopping needs.

However, the effects of suburbanisation are not solely positive; they can also have detrimental consequences for urban structures. One significant concern is urban sprawl, characterized by the unregulated expansion of urban areas. This phenomenon can lead to the depletion of agricultural land and natural habitats, as well as exacerbate traffic congestion and air pollution. Additionally, the decentralisation of urban areas may result in social segregation, as wealthier individuals tend to migrate to suburban locations, leaving economically disadvantaged populations concentrated in urban centres.
