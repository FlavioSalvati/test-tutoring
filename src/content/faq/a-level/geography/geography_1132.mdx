Solifluction is a gradual downslope movement of water-saturated soil and other materials over an impermeable layer.

This phenomenon is a specific type of mass wasting that occurs predominantly in cold regions where the ground is frozen, particularly in periglacial environments. Solifluction is characterized by the slow movement of water-saturated soil and materials down a slope, typically over a bedrock surface or a layer of permafrost. Although this movement is usually very slow—often only a few centimeters per year—it can lead to significant changes in the landscape over extended periods.

The driving force behind solifluction is the freeze-thaw cycle. During warmer months, the upper layer of soil thaws and becomes saturated with water, while the underlying layer remains frozen, creating an impermeable barrier. This situation renders the water-saturated upper layer unstable, causing it to flow downslope under the influence of gravity.

Solifluction is most prevalent in regions with frequent freeze-thaw cycles, such as those found at high latitudes or high altitudes. This process can result in the development of distinctive landforms, including solifluction lobes and terraces. These features form when the moving soil accumulates in particular areas, resulting in a stepped or lobed appearance on the hillside.

Regarding its environmental impact, solifluction can lead to significant soil erosion and may disrupt human activities such as agriculture and construction. It also has the potential to displace vegetation and other surface materials, thereby altering the local ecosystem. Despite its slow rate, the cumulative effects of solifluction over time can dramatically reshape the landscape.
