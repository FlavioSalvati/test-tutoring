A rockfall is a natural geological phenomenon in which rocks break away from a cliff face and descend due to the force of gravity.

Rockfalls are classified as a type of mass movement, also known as mass wasting, which refers to the downhill movement of rock, soil, and other materials driven primarily by gravitational forces. These events are often triggered by natural weathering processes, such as freeze-thaw cycles and wetting-drying actions, which compromise the structural integrity of the rock. Additionally, factors such as earthquakes, heavy rainfall, or human activities can also initiate rockfalls.

The process begins with the weathering of the rock face. In colder climates, water infiltrates cracks in the rock and, upon freezing, expands, leading to fractures in a process known as freeze-thaw weathering. In contrast, warmer climates experience wetting and drying cycles that cause rocks to crack and weaken over time, a phenomenon referred to as thermal stress weathering.

As the rock structure becomes weakened, it becomes more prone to detachment. This detachment can occur due to gravitational forces or be triggered by external influences. For example, an earthquake may shake rocks loose, while heavy rainfall can lubricate the rock surface, facilitating their movement. Furthermore, human activities, such as construction or mining, can destabilize the rock face, increasing the likelihood of rockfalls.

Once the rock detaches, it falls or bounces down the slope under the influence of gravity, often at significant speeds. This descent can cause extensive damage to anything in its path. The fallen rocks typically accumulate at the base of the slope, forming a rockfall talus, which is a mound of debris consisting of fallen rocks.

In summary, a rockfall is a multifaceted process shaped by various natural and anthropogenic factors. It begins with the weathering of the rock face, progresses to the detachment of the rock, and culminates in the rock's descent and accumulation at the base of the slope.
