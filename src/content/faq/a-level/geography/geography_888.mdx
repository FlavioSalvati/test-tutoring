Cyclonic rainfall is distinguished by its connection to low-pressure systems, extensive geographic coverage, and prolonged duration.

Also referred to as frontal or depression rainfall, cyclonic rainfall occurs when warm and cold air masses converge. This type of precipitation is typically linked to low-pressure systems, commonly known as cyclones or depressions. These systems are marked by circular wind patterns and inward-spiraling winds that draw moist air from the surrounding areas.

The process begins when a warm air mass encounters a cold air mass. Since warm air is lighter, it rises above the cold air. As it ascends, the warm air cools and condenses, forming clouds. This condensation process releases latent heat, which further enhances the upward movement of air, promoting the formation of additional clouds and ultimately leading to rainfall. Consequently, cyclonic rainfall often covers vast regions where warm and cold fronts interact.

A notable characteristic of cyclonic rainfall is its duration. In contrast to convective or orographic rainfall—which are generally short-lived and localized—cyclonic rainfall can persist for several days. This prolonged activity is due to the continuous process of warm air rising and condensing, sustained by the ongoing influx of moist air into the low-pressure system.

Another important feature of cyclonic rainfall is its intensity. The rainfall typically ranges from moderate to heavy, though it can fluctuate based on the temperature and moisture content of the interacting air masses. Rainfall is usually most intense near the center of the low-pressure system, where the upward air motion is strongest.

In summary, cyclonic rainfall is characterized by its association with low-pressure systems, extensive coverage, long duration, and variable intensity. It plays a vital role in the global water cycle and can significantly influence local weather patterns and climate conditions.
