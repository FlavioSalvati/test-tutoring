The dependency ratio is a key metric that quantifies the proportion of a population that relies on the working-age segment for support.

In demographic studies, the dependency ratio is vital for assessing the economic pressure placed on the productive portion of the population. It is defined as the ratio of dependents—individuals aged below $15$ and above $64$—to the working-age population, which includes those aged $15$ to $64$. A higher dependency ratio indicates a greater burden on the working population to support those who are not in the labor force.

This ratio is frequently employed to evaluate the strain on the productive population and to analyze the evolving demographic landscape of a country. For instance, a high dependency ratio may suggest that a significant portion of government resources must be allocated to social services such as pensions and healthcare, potentially leading to increased taxation on the working population. Conversely, a low dependency ratio signifies a larger working-age population, which could foster economic growth if this labor force is effectively leveraged.

The dependency ratio can be further categorized into two distinct types: the youth dependency ratio and the old-age dependency ratio. The youth dependency ratio pertains to individuals aged $0$ to $14$, while the old-age dependency ratio focuses on those aged $65$ and older. Analyzing these specific ratios can yield deeper insights into the population's age distribution and the economic challenges a country may encounter. For example, a high youth dependency ratio may signal the need for enhanced investment in education, whereas a high old-age dependency ratio could indicate a pressing requirement for healthcare services and pension systems.

In summary, the dependency ratio serves as a valuable instrument in population studies, offering insights into demographic structures and their potential economic ramifications.
