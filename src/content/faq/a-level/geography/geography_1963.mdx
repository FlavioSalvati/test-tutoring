The canopy structure in humid forest ecosystems exhibits significant variation in terms of height, density, species diversity, and stratification.

In these ecosystems, the canopy is typically characterized by a multi-layered stratification, which arises from competition for sunlightâ€”a crucial resource for photosynthesis. The tallest trees, referred to as emergents, can reach heights of up to $70$ meters. These trees are distinguished by their thick, straight trunks and small, pointed crowns, which enable them to endure the strong winds and intense sunlight found at such elevations.

Beneath the emergent layer lies the main canopy, which generally ranges from $20$ to $45$ meters in height. This layer is dense and continuous, interrupted only by the crowns of the emergent trees. The trees within this layer feature large, spreading crowns that maximize their ability to capture sunlight. Notably, this section of the forest is the most biodiverse, serving as a habitat for a wide array of species.

Below the main canopy is the understory, composed of young trees and shrubs that await opportunities to grow into the canopy when gaps arise. This layer is typically dark and damp, characterized by high humidity levels due to limited sunlight penetration. At the very bottom lies the ground layer, which consists of decomposing plant material, fungi, insects, and seedlings.

The density of the canopy in humid forests can vary significantly, influenced by factors such as the age of the forest, nutrient availability, and levels of disturbance. Older, undisturbed forests tend to feature denser canopies, while younger or disturbed forests may exhibit more open canopies.

Species diversity is another vital aspect of the canopy structure in humid forests. These ecosystems are renowned for their high species richness, with various tree species often dominating different layers of the canopy. This diversity enhances the complexity and resilience of the forest ecosystem.
