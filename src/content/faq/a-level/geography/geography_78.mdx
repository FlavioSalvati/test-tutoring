Ocean acidification presents a significant threat to coral reefs by diminishing their growth rates and increasing their vulnerability to erosion.

Ocean acidification occurs when the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) from the atmosphere, resulting in a decrease in the pH of seawater. This phenomenon has profound effects on coral reefs, which are particularly sensitive to shifts in water chemistry.

Coral reefs are formed by tiny marine organisms known as coral polyps, which secrete a hard, protective skeleton made of calcium carbonate ($\text{CaCO}_3$). The process of ocean acidification leads to a reduction in the concentration of carbonate ions in the water, which are essential for the formation of this calcium carbonate skeleton. Consequently, the growth rates of coral reefs are hindered, and existing structures become more fragile and susceptible to erosion.

Furthermore, the decrease in pH can adversely affect the physiological functions of coral polyps. It may result in a diminished reproductive capacity and a reduced ability to repair and regenerate after environmental disturbances, such as storms or disease outbreaks. This decline can further exacerbate the deterioration of coral reefs.

Additionally, ocean acidification can indirectly impact coral reefs by influencing other marine organisms. For instance, it can affect the growth and survival of specific types of algae that are crucial for the health of coral reefs. These algae engage in a symbiotic relationship with coral polyps, supplying them with nutrients and assisting in the construction of their skeletons. If these algae are adversely affected, the consequences can further weaken the resilience of coral reefs.

In summary, ocean acidification represents a critical threat to coral reefs. It not only compromises their growth and structural integrity but also hinders their ability to recover from disturbances and sustain vital symbiotic relationships. This can ultimately lead to a decline in the health and biodiversity of these essential marine ecosystems.
