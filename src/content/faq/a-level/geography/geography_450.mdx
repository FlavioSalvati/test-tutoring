Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is a widely utilized economic metric that represents the total GDP of a country divided by its population. While it serves as an indicator of a nation's standard of living, it has notable limitations when assessing income inequality.

Firstly, GDP per capita is merely an average, and thus it fails to illustrate the distribution of wealth within a country. For instance, a nation might report a high GDP per capita due to a small segment of the population being extraordinarily wealthy, while the majority of citizens remain impoverished. Such a scenario would indicate a significant level of inequality that is not reflected in the GDP per capita figure.

Secondly, GDP per capita does not account for variations in the cost of living across different regions or countries. A high GDP per capita may not necessarily equate to a high quality of life if the prices of goods and services are also elevated. This consideration becomes particularly important when making international comparisons of GDP per capita.

Thirdly, GDP per capita overlooks non-monetary dimensions of well-being, such as health, education, and overall quality of life. These factors can greatly influence an individual's standard of living and the level of inequality they experience, yet they remain unmeasured by GDP per capita.

Lastly, GDP per capita does not incorporate the informal economy, which can be substantial in certain countries. Activities such as bartering or unregistered businesses contribute to people's livelihoods but do not factor into the official GDP calculation.

In summary, while GDP per capita can offer a valuable overview of a country's economic performance, it is an inadequate instrument for measuring inequality. Alternative measures, such as the Gini coefficient or the Human Development Index (HDI), can provide a more comprehensive understanding of inequality within and across nations.
