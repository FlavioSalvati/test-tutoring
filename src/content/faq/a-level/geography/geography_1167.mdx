Coastal processes significantly influence slope stability, which can result in erosion, landslides, and various other forms of slope failure.

Key coastal processes, such as wave action, tidal movements, and longshore drift, play an essential role in shaping the stability of coastal slopes. These activities can erode the base of slopes, diminishing their stability and heightening the risk of landslides and other slope failures.

Wave action, especially during storms, can lead to the erosion of cliffs and slopes by creating a notch at their bases. This undercutting process destabilizes the slopes, potentially causing rockfalls and landslides. This phenomenon is referred to as wave quarrying, where the force of the waves removes material from the cliff base, resulting in the collapse of the overlying rock.

Tidal movements also contribute to slope instability. The continuous ebb and flow of tides can saturate slope materials, increasing their weight while reducing their shear strength, which is the material's resistance to deformation. This saturation can trigger a specific type of landslide known as a mudslide, where saturated soil and rock descend the slope.

Longshore drift, the mechanism by which sediment is transported parallel to the coastline, can further impact slope stability. This process may lead to the erosion or deposition of materials at the base of slopes, thereby altering their stability. For instance, if longshore drift removes material from the base of a slope, that slope may become unstable and more susceptible to failure. Conversely, if material is deposited at the base, it can enhance support and improve stability.

Moreover, rising sea levels associated with climate change can intensify these coastal processes. Increased sea levels can amplify wave action and tidal movements, leading to enhanced erosion and greater slope instability. This situation underscores the dynamic and interconnected nature of coastal processes and their profound impact on slope stability.
