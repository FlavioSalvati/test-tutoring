Granite landscapes are vital contributors to biodiversity in tropical regions, as they offer unique habitats and microclimates that support a variety of species.

Characterized by their rocky outcrops and boulders, granite landscapes enhance biodiversity by creating a rugged and diverse environment. This variability results in numerous niches and microhabitats, including crevices, caves, and ephemeral pools of water. Each of these microhabitats provides distinct conditions that enable different species to thrive, leading to a high level of species richness within the same landscape.

Moreover, granite landscapes significantly influence local climate conditions, resulting in microclimates that can support an extensive range of species. For example, the shade cast by large boulders can create cooler and more humid environments, which are ideal for specific plants and animals. In contrast, sunlit surfaces can generate warmer and drier conditions that favor other species. These varied microclimates help sustain a wide array of organisms, each adapted to their particular environmental conditions.

Additionally, granite landscapes are effective at water retention. The crevices and cracks within the granite can capture and store rainwater, providing a crucial water source for many species during dry spells. This capacity for water retention supports a diverse range of aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms, further enhancing the area's overall biodiversity.

Finally, due to their rugged nature, granite landscapes are often resistant to human activities such as agriculture and urbanization. This resilience helps preserve habitats and protect biodiversity, as these landscapes are less likely to be disturbed or destroyed by human encroachment. Consequently, granite landscapes contribute to biodiversity not only by creating unique habitats and microclimates but also by playing a critical role in habitat preservation.
