Migration can lead to a decline in population, brain drain, shifts in age structure, and altered gender ratios in source countries.

Migration, especially when it involves individuals relocating from less developed to more developed nations, has significant demographic effects on the countries of origin. One of the most immediate consequences is a reduction in the overall population size. This effect is particularly pronounced in countries with high emigration rates. For example, Eastern European nations such as Lithuania and Romania have experienced considerable population declines due to the outflow of their citizens.

Another major impact of migration is the phenomenon known as "brain drain." This term refers to the emigration of highly skilled or well-educated individuals from their home country. Brain drain can have severe repercussions for a country's development and economic growth. For instance, numerous African nations have seen a substantial number of their healthcare professionals leave, resulting in critical shortages of skilled personnel in the healthcare sector.

Migration can also lead to shifts in the age structure of a population. Typically, it is the younger, working-age individuals who are most likely to migrate in pursuit of better opportunities. This trend can result in an ageing population in the source country, accompanied by a higher dependency ratio. Countries such as Japan and Italy are currently facing challenges related to an ageing population, in part due to the emigration of their younger generation.

Furthermore, migration can influence the gender balance within a nation. In some cases, men are more likely to migrate, which leaves behind a higher proportion of women. This discrepancy can lead to a skewed gender ratio, with various social and economic implications. For instance, both China and India exhibit significant gender imbalances, largely due to cultural preferences for male children and the subsequent migration of females.

In conclusion, migration has profound demographic effects on source countries, influencing population size, skill levels, age distribution, and gender balance. These changes can have far-reaching consequences for a nation's social and economic development.
