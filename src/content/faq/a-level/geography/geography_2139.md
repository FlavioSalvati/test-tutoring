Human activities significantly modify the characteristics of coastal landforms through construction, pollution, deforestation, and climate change.

Coastal regions are often densely populated and heavily developed, which can drastically affect the natural features of these landscapes. The construction of buildings, roads, and other infrastructures typically results in the removal of natural vegetation and alterations to the land's topography. Such changes can exacerbate erosion and sedimentation, thereby influencing the shape and composition of the coastline. For instance, the installation of sea walls designed to protect properties from rising sea levels can disrupt natural coastal processes, leading to increased erosion in other areas along the coast.

Pollution is another critical factor influencing coastal landforms. Industrial activities frequently result in the discharge of pollutants into the environment, which can severely impact coastal ecosystems. For example, oil spills can cause long-lasting damage to coastal habitats, affecting the health of vegetation and wildlife that are vital for maintaining the stability of these landforms. Additionally, the accumulation of plastic waste on beaches can alter their physical appearance and potentially affect coastal processes such as wave action and tidal movements.

Deforestation, often driven by agricultural expansion or urban development, also significantly impacts coastal landforms. Trees and other vegetation are essential for stabilizing soil and reducing erosion. When these plants are removed, it can lead to increased sedimentation in coastal areas, further altering the shape and composition of the coastline.

Lastly, human-induced climate change is profoundly affecting coastal landforms. Rising sea levels, attributed to the melting of polar ice caps and the thermal expansion of oceans, are contributing to heightened coastal erosion and flooding. This phenomenon is reshaping coastlines and could result in the complete loss of certain coastal features. Moreover, the increased intensity of storms, another consequence of climate change, can inflict further erosion and damage to coastal regions.
