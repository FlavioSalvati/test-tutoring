The structure of rock plays a crucial role in determining both the rate and type of weathering it experiences. Key factors influencing this process include the mineral composition, permeability, and the presence of joints within the rock.

The mineral composition of a rock is a primary determinant of its resistance to weathering. For example, quartz exhibits a high resistance to both chemical and physical weathering, whereas feldspar is more vulnerable to chemical weathering. Consequently, rocks that are rich in resistant minerals, such as granite, tend to weather more slowly than those that contain less resistant minerals.

Permeability, defined as a rock's ability to transmit water, also significantly impacts weathering. Highly permeable rocks, such as sandstone, facilitate the flow of water through their structure, thereby enhancing chemical weathering processes like solution and hydrolysis. In contrast, rocks with low permeability, such as clay, tend to retain water on their surface, which can promote physical weathering processes like freeze-thaw cycles.

The presence of joints, cracks, and fissures within a rock's structure can further influence the weathering process. These features create pathways for water and air to infiltrate the rock, increasing the surface area that is exposed to weathering agents. This can accelerate both physical and chemical weathering. For instance, during freeze-thaw weathering, water can infiltrate the joints, freeze, expand, and exert pressure on the rock, leading to fragmentation.

Additionally, the orientation of rock layers, or bedding planes, can affect weathering dynamics. In formations with horizontal bedding planes, water can accumulate, thereby enhancing weathering. In contrast, in formations with vertical bedding planes, water tends to runoff, which can reduce the extent of weathering.

In summary, the overall structure of a rock—including its mineral composition, permeability, jointing, and the orientation of bedding planes—significantly influences the rate and type of weathering it undergoes. Understanding these factors is essential for predicting how different rock types will respond to various weathering processes.
