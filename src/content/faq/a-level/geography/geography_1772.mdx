Globalization and technology play crucial roles in shaping the dynamics of world cities, driving economic growth, facilitating cultural exchange, and promoting urban development.

Globalization refers to the process by which businesses and organizations expand their influence and operations on an international scale. This phenomenon has a profound effect on world cities. For example, globalization has spurred the growth of multinational corporations, many of which establish their headquarters in major urban centers. This influx not only boosts the local economy but also stimulates urban development, as new infrastructure is constructed to accommodate these corporations.

Additionally, globalization has led to increased migration, as individuals from various regions seek better job opportunities in these cities. This migration contributes to a rich cultural tapestry, enhancing the diversity of urban environments. However, it also presents challenges such as overcrowding and heightened demand for resources, which need to be managed effectively.

On the other hand, technology has transformed the operational landscape of world cities. The rise of the internet and digital technologies has enabled businesses to transcend geographical boundaries, further accelerating the process of globalization. 

Moreover, technology has significantly improved urban life in world cities. Innovations such as intelligent transport systems, smart grids, and digital governance services have enhanced the quality of life for residents. These advancements contribute to making cities more efficient, sustainable, and livable.

Nevertheless, the impact of technology is not universally beneficial. The digital divide can exacerbate social inequalities within urban areas. Individuals lacking access to digital technologies may find themselves disadvantaged in an increasingly digitized world.

In summary, globalization and technology significantly influence world cities by driving economic growth, fostering cultural exchange, and facilitating urban development. However, they also present challenges that must be addressed to ensure that all residents can reap the benefits of these changes.
