Freeze-thaw action is a critical factor in slope instability, as it weakens the rock structure, ultimately leading to fragmentation and an increased risk of landslides.

Also referred to as frost weathering, freeze-thaw action is a natural phenomenon that occurs in environments where temperatures fluctuate around the freezing point. This cycle can significantly destabilize slopes, resulting in landslides and various forms of mass wasting.

During warmer periods, water infiltrates the cracks and pores of rocks. When temperatures drop and the water freezes, it expands by approximately $9\%$. This expansion generates pressure on the surrounding rock, causing it to crack and weaken. Over time, repeated cycles of freezing and thawing contribute to the mechanical weathering of the rock, leading to its fragmentation.

The resulting fragmented rock material, often referred to as scree, can accumulate on the slope, increasing both the weight and pressure on the surface. This additional weight can destabilize the slope, making it more vulnerable to landslides, particularly during heavy rainfall or rapid snowmelt. As water infiltrates the accumulated material, it further increases the weight and reduces friction with the underlying rock, heightening the likelihood of a slide.

Additionally, freeze-thaw action can give rise to features such as solifluction lobes and terraces. These are characterized by the slow, downslope movement of water-saturated soil and rock debris, which can further destabilize the slope by altering its shape and structural integrity.

In conclusion, freeze-thaw action significantly influences slope instability. It weakens and fragments rock, adds weight to the slope, and modifies the slope's structure, all of which increase the risk of landslides and other forms of mass wasting.
