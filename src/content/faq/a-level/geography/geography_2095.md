Cliffs and wave-cut platforms are geological features formed through the erosive action of waves along coastlines.

Cliffs develop as waves erode the base of a rock face, leading to structural instability and eventual collapse. This phenomenon is referred to as wave-cut cliff formation. Waves, propelled by wind, relentlessly crash against the coastline, gradually weakening the rock over time. This process is particularly pronounced in softer rocks such as sandstone and limestone. The continuous impact of the waves creates a notch at the base of the rock face. As this notch deepens, the overhanging rock becomes increasingly unstable and ultimately gives way under its own weight. The debris from the collapse is then swept away by the waves, resulting in the formation of a steep cliff face.

In contrast, wave-cut platforms are the flat or gently sloping rocky surfaces that remain at the base of a cliff after it has retreated due to erosion. This process is known as wave-cut platform formation. As the cliff recedes, waves continue to erode the base of the newly exposed cliff face, leaving behind a flat or gently sloping platform. This platform is typically exposed during low tide and submerged during high tide. Over time, the platform can expand in width as the cliff continues to retreat.

Both cliffs and wave-cut platforms serve as compelling evidence of the formidable erosive power of waves. These dynamic features are in constant flux, shaped by the relentless action of the waves over time. The rate at which these features form and evolve is influenced by various factors, including wave strength, rock type, and the presence of protective elements such as beaches or human-made sea defenses.
