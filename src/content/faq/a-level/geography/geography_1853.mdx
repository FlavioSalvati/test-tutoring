Shanty towns have a profound influence on urban aesthetics and city planning, creating visual disparities and presenting infrastructural challenges.

Often referred to as slums or informal settlements, shanty towns are characterized by overcrowded and substandard housing conditions. They typically arise in regions where urban planning is either nonexistent or ineffective, resulting in a stark contrast with the more developed areas of the city. This visual disparity can greatly affect the overall aesthetics of the urban landscape. The unplanned and chaotic nature of shanty towns often leads to a lack of uniformity and coherence in the city's architectural and spatial design, which can be visually jarring.

From a city planning perspective, shanty towns pose numerous challenges. The absence of formal infrastructure—such as roads, sewage systems, and utilities—complicates efforts to integrate these areas into the broader urban fabric. Additionally, the high population density and informal nature of these settlements hinder the provision of essential services like water, electricity, and waste management. This lack of services can lead to health and environmental issues, further complicating the challenges faced by city planners.

Furthermore, shanty towns present significant social and economic challenges that impact city planning. Elevated levels of poverty and unemployment, combined with limited access to education and healthcare, can foster social instability and crime, complicating urban planning initiatives. The informal economy that often flourishes in these areas is also difficult to regulate and integrate into the formal economy of the city.

In summary, shanty towns substantially affect urban aesthetics by creating visual disparities and pose a variety of challenges for city planning, including infrastructural, social, and economic issues.
