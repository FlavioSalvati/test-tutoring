Infant mortality rates play a crucial role in shaping population dynamics, as high rates can lead to slower population growth.

The infant mortality rate (IMR) is a vital demographic indicator that measures the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births in a specific year. This metric is essential for understanding population change, as it directly affects the rate of natural increase (RNI), defined as the difference between the birth rate and the death rate.

When the IMR is elevated, it indicates that a substantial number of infants do not survive their first year. This situation typically results in a slower population growth rate, since the number of new individuals added to the population through births is offset by the number of infant deaths. In extreme cases, a high IMR can lead to population decline if the number of deaths surpasses the number of births.

Furthermore, a high IMR can indirectly influence population change by affecting fertility rates. In communities with elevated IMR, parents often choose to have more children to counterbalance the anticipated loss of some. This phenomenon, known as "child replacement," may lead to a temporary surge in population growth. However, as healthcare improves and living conditions enhance, a reduction in IMR may prompt parents to opt for smaller families, resulting in lower fertility rates and, consequently, slower population growth.

Conversely, a low IMR is typically linked to stable or growing populations. When more infants survive their first year, the population can experience more rapid growth, provided that fertility rates remain high. However, as societies advance and IMR declines, fertility rates often decrease as well, which can lead to slower population growth.

In summary, the relationship between IMR and population change is intricate and multifaceted. It encompasses direct impacts on the rate of natural increase and indirect effects on fertility rates, both of which significantly shape population dynamics.
