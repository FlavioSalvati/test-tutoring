Solar radiation, also referred to as solar insolation, represents the electromagnetic energy emitted by the sun that reaches the Earth's surface. This energy is not uniform throughout the day; instead, it fluctuates based on the sun's position in the sky. The maximum levels of solar radiation typically occur around noon, when the sun is at its zenith. At this time, the sun's rays travel the shortest distance through the Earth's atmosphere, which minimizes scattering and absorption of solar energy, resulting in heightened radiation levels reaching the surface.

Conversely, during the early morning and late evening, when the sun is positioned low in the sky, its rays traverse a greater expanse of the Earth's atmosphere. This extended path leads to increased scattering and absorption of solar energy, which in turn results in lower levels of solar radiation at the surface. Consequently, temperatures during these times of day are typically cooler.

Moreover, the angle at which sunlight strikes the Earth's surface significantly influences the intensity of solar radiation. When the sun is directly overhead, its rays impact the surface at a $90^\circ$ angle, yielding maximum intensity. However, when the sun is lower in the sky, its rays hit the surface at a smaller angle, distributing the same amount of energy over a larger area and consequently diminishing the intensity of the radiation.

In addition to these daily variations, solar radiation also changes throughout the year due to the tilt of the Earth's axis. This axial tilt causes variations in day length and the angle of the sun's rays, ultimately affecting the quantity of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface.
