Urban areas typically reduce the response time of hydrographs due to the increased surface runoff generated by impermeable surfaces.

To elaborate, the response time of a hydrograph refers to the duration it takes for water to travel from a specific point in the catchment area to the river. In urban environments, this response time is frequently diminished. This reduction is primarily attributed to the extensive presence of impermeable surfaces, such as concrete and asphalt, which inhibit water infiltration into the soil. Consequently, rainfall is swiftly channeled into drainage systems and then directed into rivers, resulting in a rapid increase in river levels.

Moreover, urban areas often feature comprehensive and efficient drainage systems designed to quickly evacuate water from surfaces, thereby mitigating the risk of localized flooding. These systems further contribute to a shortened response time on hydrographs, as water is rapidly collected and transported to the river, circumventing the slower natural processes like throughflow and baseflow.

Another significant factor is the removal of vegetation in urban settings. Plants and trees play a vital role in the hydrological cycle by intercepting rainfall and facilitating infiltration. In the absence of this greenery, more water directly reaches the ground, which can quickly transform into surface runoff.

It is essential to recognize, however, that while urban areas generally lead to a decrease in hydrograph response times, the specific impacts can vary based on several factors. These include the intensity and duration of rainfall, the design and maintenance of the urban drainage system, and the characteristics of the local catchment area. For instance, an urban area with a poorly maintained drainage system may exhibit a slower response time compared to one equipped with a well-designed and efficient system.
