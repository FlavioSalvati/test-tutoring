Wave frequency plays a significant role in the formation and erosion of coastal landforms by determining the energy and force of the waves.

Wave frequency, defined as the number of waves passing a fixed point per second, is a critical factor in shaping coastal features. High-frequency waves, which carry more energy, possess greater erosive power. This energy leads to the formation of prominent features such as cliffs, wave-cut platforms, and sea arches. These waves break with considerable force, effectively removing material from the coastline and sculpting steep, rugged landforms.

In contrast, low-frequency waves have less energy and are more likely to deposit material along the coast. This process contributes to the creation of features such as beaches, spits, and bars. Low-frequency waves gently lap against the shore, allowing sediment to settle and accumulate over time, resulting in flatter, more expansive coastal landforms.

The frequency of waves also impacts the rate of coastal erosion. High-frequency waves can cause rapid erosion, particularly in areas composed of softer rock types. This erosion can lead to the development of features such as caves and stacks as the waves carve into the coastline. Conversely, regions exposed to low-frequency waves typically experience slower erosion rates, allowing for the formation of more stable and enduring landforms.

Moreover, wave frequency affects the movement of sediment along the coast, a process known as longshore drift. High-frequency waves can transport sediment more rapidly, leading to significant alterations in the shape and position of coastal features. In contrast, low-frequency waves may result in slower, more gradual changes to the coastline.

In summary, wave frequency is essential in shaping coastal landscapes, influencing the type, size, and rate of formation of various coastal landforms. Understanding this relationship is crucial for predicting and managing future changes to our coastlines.
