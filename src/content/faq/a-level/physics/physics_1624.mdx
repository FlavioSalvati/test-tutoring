A longitudinal wave is a type of wave in which the particles of the medium oscillate parallel to the direction of wave propagation. In contrast, a transverse wave is characterized by particle oscillation that occurs perpendicular to the direction of wave motion.

Longitudinal waves are often referred to as compression waves, as the particles within the medium experience periods of compression and rarefaction as the wave travels through. Common examples of longitudinal waves include sound waves and seismic waves. In a sound wave, the regions of compression correspond to areas of high pressure, while the regions of rarefaction correspond to areas of low pressure.

Transverse waves, on the other hand, are known as shear waves because the particles in the medium are displaced perpendicularly to the wave's direction of travel. Examples of transverse waves include electromagnetic waves and water waves. In an electromagnetic wave, both the electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. In the case of water waves, the water's surface moves up and down, also perpendicular to the direction of wave motion.

Both longitudinal and transverse waves possess distinct properties, such as wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and velocity. Understanding these properties is crucial for comprehending wave behavior across various media, and is applicable in diverse fields including communication, medicine, and engineering.
