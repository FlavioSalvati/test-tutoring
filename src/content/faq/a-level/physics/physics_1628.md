Neutron stars are the remnants left behind after supernova explosions.

When a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it loses the ability to generate the energy necessary to counteract the force of gravity. Consequently, the core of the star collapses inward, resulting in a powerful explosion known as a supernova. This cataclysmic event expels the outer layers of the star, leaving behind a highly dense core called a neutron star.

Neutron stars are astonishingly dense; they can possess a mass greater than that of the Sun compressed into a sphere only a few kilometers in diameter. This extreme density arises because the core is composed predominantly of neutrons, which are packed closely together. The intense gravitational field of a neutron star is so strong that it distorts the fabric of spacetime itself and can even bend light.

Additionally, neutron stars are characterized by their rapid rotation, with some spinning several hundred times per second. This swift rotation is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum during the collapse of the star's core. As the core contracts, it spins fasterâ€”similar to a figure skater who accelerates by pulling in their arms.

In summary, neutron stars are formed from the remnants of supernova explosions. These extraordinarily dense objects are composed of tightly packed neutrons and are notable for their powerful gravitational fields and rapid rotation.
