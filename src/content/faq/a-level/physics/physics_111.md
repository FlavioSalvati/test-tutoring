A transformer operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction to transfer electrical energy between two coils within an alternating current (AC) circuit.

Transformers are devices specifically designed to modify the voltage in an AC circuit. They consist of two wire coils, referred to as the primary and secondary coils, which are wound around a shared iron core. When an AC voltage is applied to the primary coil, it generates a fluctuating magnetic field around the iron core. This varying magnetic field induces a voltage in the secondary coil, which is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of turns in each coil. Consequently, the voltage in the secondary coil can be either greater or lesser than that in the primary coil, depending on the turns ratio.

The efficiency of a transformer is influenced by its design and the materials used in its construction. Transformers are typically engineered to function optimally at a specific frequency; thus, variations in the frequency or voltage of the AC input can affect their performance. These devices find applications in a diverse array of fields, including power distribution, electronic devices, and audio equipment.

In summary, transformers are vital components in AC circuits, facilitating the effective transfer of energy across different voltage levels. A solid understanding of how transformers function is crucial for anyone studying A-Level Physics, as it lays the groundwork for comprehending more intricate electrical systems.
