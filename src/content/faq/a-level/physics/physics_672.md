The strength of an electric field diminishes as the distance from its source increases.

Electric fields are generated by charged particles and are quantified in volts per meter (V/m). The intensity of an electric field is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charge producing the field, while it is inversely proportional to the distance from that charge. In simpler terms, as you move further away from the source of the electric field, its strength decreases.

This relationship between electric field strength and distance is articulated by Coulomb's law. According to this law, the force between two charged particles is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them. Consequently, if the distance between two charged particles is doubled, the force acting between them decreases by a factor of four.

In practical terms, this means that as you distance yourself from a source of electric charge—such as a battery or an electrically charged object—the strength of the electric field diminishes. This principle explains why electric fields are weaker at greater distances and highlights the importance of maintaining a safe distance from high-voltage power lines or other sources of high-voltage electricity.
