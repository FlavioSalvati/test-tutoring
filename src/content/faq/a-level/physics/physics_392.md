Materials can experience four primary types of stress: tensile, compressive, shear, and torsional stress.

**Tensile Stress** occurs when a material is subjected to forces that pull it apart, resulting in elongation. This type of stress is frequently observed in structures such as bridges, cables, and ropes.

**Compressive Stress** arises when a material is compressed or pushed together, leading to a reduction in its length. This type of stress is commonly found in supporting structures like columns, pillars, and walls.

**Shear Stress** is generated when forces are applied in parallel but opposite directions, causing a material to slide or twist. This type of stress is often seen in components such as bolts, rivets, and gears.

**Torsional Stress** takes place when a material is twisted about its axis, resulting in deformation. This kind of stress is typically encountered in mechanical elements like shafts, propellers, and turbines.

It is essential to recognize that materials can simultaneously experience a combination of these stress types. The manner in which they respond to these stresses can vary significantly based on their properties and composition. A thorough understanding of the different stress types that materials can endure is vital for the effective design and engineering of structures that can withstand these forces.
