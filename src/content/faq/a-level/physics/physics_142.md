The mass of a star is a fundamental factor that influences its lifespan, temperature, luminosity, and ultimate fate.

A star's evolution—from its formation to its demise—is primarily dictated by its mass. The mass impacts the temperature and pressure within the star's core, which subsequently affects the rate of nuclear fusion reactions that generate the star's energy. More massive stars experience higher core temperatures and pressures, enabling them to fuse heavier elements and consume their nuclear fuel at a faster rate. As a result, these stars have significantly shorter lifespans compared to their less massive counterparts.

Additionally, a star's mass influences its luminosity, which is defined as the amount of energy it emits per unit of time. More massive stars are inherently brighter and more luminous than their less massive peers, as they possess greater quantities of fuel and a larger surface area from which to radiate energy.

As a star progresses through its life cycle, its mass ultimately determines its fate. Less massive stars, such as our Sun, will exhaust their nuclear fuel and evolve into white dwarfs. In contrast, more massive stars will culminate in a dramatic supernova explosion, leading to the formation of either a neutron star or a black hole.

In conclusion, a star's mass is a critical determinant of its evolutionary path, influencing everything from its temperature and luminosity to its final destiny. Understanding the intricate relationship between mass and stellar evolution is essential for studying the life cycles of stars and the broader dynamics of the universe.
