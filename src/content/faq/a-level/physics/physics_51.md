Radioactive decay adheres to first-order kinetics, which is a consequence of the inherently random nature of decay events and the constant probability of decay occurring per unit time.

In first-order kinetics, the decay rate is directly proportional to the quantity of radioactive nuclei present. This relationship implies that a greater number of radioactive nuclei results in a faster decay rate. However, it is important to note that the probability of decay for each nucleus remains constant over time, irrespective of the total number of nuclei. This constancy arises because the decay of each nucleus happens independently of the decay of others.

The constant probability of decay per unit time is referred to as the decay constant, denoted by the symbol $\lambda$. The rate of decay can be mathematically expressed using the equation:

$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N
$$

where $N$ represents the number of radioactive nuclei and $t$ denotes time.

The half-life of a radioactive substance is defined as the duration required for half of the radioactive nuclei to decay. This property is intrinsic to the substance and is linked to the decay constant through the following equation:

$$
t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}
$$

The half-life is independent of the initial quantity of nuclei and serves as a crucial parameter for dating geological formations and fossils.

In conclusion, radioactive decay exemplifies first-order kinetics due to the random nature of decay and the constant probability of decay per unit time. This framework enables the calculation of both the decay constant and the half-life of a radioactive substance, which are vital parameters in fields such as nuclear physics, geology, and medicine.
