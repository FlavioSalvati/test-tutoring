To calculate the electric field generated by a charged rod, we can apply Coulomb's law in conjunction with integration techniques.

Coulomb's law states that the electric field $ E $ at a specific point due to a charged particle is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charge $ q $ and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $ r $ from the charge. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
E = k \frac{q}{r^2}
$$

where $ k $ is Coulomb's constant. To determine the electric field due to a charged rod, we must consider the contributions from all infinitesimal charge elements along the rod.

Assuming the rod is infinitely long and uniformly charged, we can find the electric field at a point $ P $ located at a distance $ r $ from the rod by dividing the rod into small segments of length $ dl $. Each segment carries a small charge $ dq $. The electric field $ dE $ contributed by each segment at point $ P $ can be expressed as:

$$
dE = k \frac{dq}{r^2}
$$

To obtain the total electric field $ E $ at point $ P $, we integrate the contributions from all the segments of the rod:

$$
E = \int dE = \int k \frac{dq}{r^2}
$$

If the rod is not uniformly charged, we can still apply Coulomb's law and integration. In this case, we need to segment the rod into smaller pieces and determine the electric field due to each segment. We then integrate these contributions to find the total electric field at the desired point.

In summary, to calculate the electric field due to a charged rod, we utilize Coulomb's law and integration. We divide the rod into infinitesimal segments, compute the electric field contribution from each segment, and integrate these contributions to determine the total electric field at the point of interest.
