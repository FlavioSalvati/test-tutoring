Wave refraction refers to the bending of waves as they transition from one medium to another.

When waves encounter a boundary between different media, such as moving from deep to shallow water, they change direction due to alterations in their speed. This phenomenon is known as refraction. The extent of the bending is influenced by the angle at which the wave strikes the boundary and the disparity in wave speeds between the two media.

For instance, in the case of water waves approaching a coastline, they tend to refract towards shallower areas. Consequently, these waves often strike the coastline at an angle rather than head-on, which can lead to processes of erosion and sediment deposition. Additionally, the configuration of the coastline plays a significant role in wave refraction; curved coastlines tend to cause more pronounced refraction compared to straight coastlines.

Wave refraction is not limited to water waves; it also occurs with other types of waves, such as light waves. When light transitions from one medium to another—like from air into water—it refracts due to changes in speed. This refraction is the reason objects appear distorted when viewed through water, such as the way a straw looks bent when placed in a glass of water.

Understanding wave refraction is crucial in various fields, including oceanography, coastal engineering, and optics. By accurately predicting how waves will refract, scientists and engineers can design structures and systems that are better equipped to withstand the forces exerted by waves and light.
