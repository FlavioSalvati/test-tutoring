The evolution of a star is influenced by several key properties, including its mass, temperature, and composition.

The mass of a star is the most critical factor in determining its evolutionary path. Specifically, a star's mass dictates the temperature and pressure in its core, which directly influence the rate of nuclear fusion reactions that fuel the star. High-mass stars typically have shorter lifespans and culminate their existence in dramatic supernova explosions. In contrast, low-mass stars can sustain themselves for billions of years, eventually fading into white dwarfs.

Temperature also plays a significant role in stellar evolution. A star's temperature establishes the equilibrium between the inward pull of gravity and the outward push of radiation pressure. Hotter stars generate higher radiation pressure, which counterbalances gravitational forces and can slow their evolutionary processes. Conversely, cooler stars exhibit lower radiation pressure, resulting in a more rapid evolution.

The chemical composition of a star additionally affects its evolution. The abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium—commonly referred to as metallicity—can alter the rate of nuclear fusion reactions and the total energy output of the star. Generally, stars with higher metallicity tend to have shorter lifetimes and evolve more rapidly than those with lower metallicity.

Other factors, such as stellar rotation, magnetic fields, and binary companions, can also impact a star's evolution. These elements can modify a star's internal structure and influence its developmental trajectory. Understanding the properties of stars and their evolutionary processes is a fundamental area of research within astrophysics.
