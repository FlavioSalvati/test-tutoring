To calculate the strain experienced by a material under stress, you divide the change in length by the original length of the material.

When a material is subjected to stress, it undergoes deformation, resulting in a change in its shape or dimensions. The extent of this deformation is quantified by strain, which is defined as the change in length per unit of the original length. Notably, strain is a dimensionless quantity and is typically expressed either as a percentage or in parts per million (ppm).

To compute the strain in a material, you need to know both the original length and the change in length caused by the applied stress. Strain is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Strain} = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}
$$

where $\Delta L$ represents the change in length and $L_0$ is the original length. For example, if a material with an original length of $10 \, \text{cm}$ is stretched to a length of $11 \, \text{cm}$, the strain can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Strain} = \frac{11 \, \text{cm} - 10 \, \text{cm}}{10 \, \text{cm}} = \frac{1 \, \text{cm}}{10 \, \text{cm}} = 0.1 \quad \text{or} \quad 10\%.
$$

Strain is a crucial parameter in materials science and engineering, as it helps describe how materials respond to various types of stress, including tension, compression, and shear. The relationship between stress and strain is characterized by the material's elastic modulus, which measures the material's stiffness or resistance to deformation. The elastic modulus varies among materials and is instrumental in predicting their behavior under different stress conditions.
