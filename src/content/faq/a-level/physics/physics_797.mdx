The distances to distant galaxies are ascertained using several techniques, including the use of standard candles and redshift measurements.

One prominent method for measuring the distance to a galaxy involves the use of standard candles. Standard candles are astronomical objects with a known intrinsic luminosity, such as Cepheid variables or Type Ia supernovae. By observing the apparent brightness of these standard candles, astronomers can apply the inverse square law of light to determine the distance to the galaxy.

Another effective technique for distance measurement is redshift, which refers to the change in the wavelength of light due to the Doppler effect. When galaxies are moving away from us, their light is shifted toward the red end of the spectrum. By measuring this redshift, astronomers can calculate the galaxy's velocity and, consequently, its distance using Hubble's law.

Additionally, the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) serves as another method for determining distances in the universe. The CMB is the remnant radiation from the early universe and is almost uniformly distributed across the sky, albeit with slight temperature fluctuations. By analyzing these fluctuations, astronomers can estimate the distance to the last scattering surface, which marks the epoch when the universe first became transparent to light.

In summary, accurately determining the distances to far-off galaxies is a multifaceted endeavor that employs various methods and techniques. These approaches are continually being refined and enhanced, enabling astronomers to deepen their understanding of the universe's structure and evolution.
