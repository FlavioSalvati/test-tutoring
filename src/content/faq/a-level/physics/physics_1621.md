A time projection chamber (TPC) is an advanced particle detector designed to track the trajectories of charged particles with high precision.

Within the chamber, a gas is maintained under a high-voltage electric field. When a charged particle traverses this gas, it ionizes the gas atoms, resulting in the formation of a trail of electrons and ions. The electric field then drives these charged particles towards the end of the chamber, where they are detected by wire planes.

The wire planes are organized in a grid pattern, with one plane oriented perpendicular to the others. As charged particles pass through these wire planes, they generate small electrical signals. By measuring the time it takes for these signals to reach each wire plane, the spatial coordinates of the particle can be accurately determined in three dimensions.

In addition to tracking particle paths, the TPC can also measure the energy of the particles. This is achieved by quantifying the amount of ionization produced as a particle moves through the gas. This energy information is crucial for identifying the type of particle that has passed through the chamber.

In summary, the time projection chamber is a powerful instrument for investigating the properties of charged particles and has been employed in a diverse array of experiments within the field of particle physics.
