The phase relationship between current and voltage in an alternating current (AC) circuit is influenced by the specific type of circuit configuration.

In a purely resistive circuit, the current and voltage are in phase, meaning they reach their maximum and minimum values simultaneously. This alignment occurs because the current is directly proportional to the voltage, as described by Ohm's Law, which can be expressed as:

$$
V = I \cdot R
$$

where $V$ is the voltage, $I$ is the current, and $R$ is the resistance.

In an inductive circuit, such as one containing coils or transformers, the current lags behind the voltage by $90^\circ$. This lag occurs because the magnetic field produced by the changing current induces a voltage in the opposite direction, opposing the original voltage and creating a delay in the current flow.

Conversely, in a capacitive circuit, such as one with a capacitor, the current leads the voltage by $90^\circ$. This phenomenon happens because the capacitor stores energy in an electric field, which results in a buildup of voltage across it. As the voltage increases, the current also rises, but there is a delay due to the time it takes for the capacitor to charge.

In circuits that contain both inductive and capacitive elements, the phase relationship between current and voltage can become more intricate. This complexity depends on the frequency and magnitude of the AC signal. Such interactions can lead to resonance and other phenomena that require careful analysis to ensure effective design and operation of the circuit.
