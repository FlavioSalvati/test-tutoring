The principle of wave reflection states that when a wave encounters a boundary, it may be partially or completely reflected back. 

When a wave meets a boundary, the reflection can vary based on the properties of the media on either side of the boundary. Specifically, if the two media possess different densities, the wave will be partially reflected and partially transmitted. Notably, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, denoted as $\theta_i = \theta_r$. Additionally, if the wave travels from a denser medium to a less dense medium, the reflected wave will be inverted.

In scenarios involving a completely reflective boundary, the wave is reflected back with the same amplitude and frequency as the incident wave. This phenomenon is known as a standing wave, which occurs when the incident and reflected waves interfere constructively. Standing waves are frequently observed in musical instruments, such as guitar strings and organ pipes.

Wave reflection can also occur at curved boundaries. In these cases, the angles of incidence and reflection are not necessarily equal, and the reflected wave may be focused or dispersed depending on the curvature of the boundary.

In summary, wave reflection is a fundamental aspect of wave behavior that occurs when waves encounter boundaries. The degree of reflection is influenced by the properties of the adjoining media, and the angles of incidence and reflection are equal. Moreover, standing waves, along with focused or dispersed waves, can emerge as a result of this reflection process.
