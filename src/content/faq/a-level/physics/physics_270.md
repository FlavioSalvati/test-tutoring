X-rays pose a risk to living tissues due to their high energy levels, which enable them to ionize atoms.

X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation characterized by high energy and short wavelengths. When X-rays traverse living tissues, they can ionize atoms by dislodging electrons from their orbitals. This ionization process can damage the DNA within cells, potentially leading to mutations and an increased risk of cancer.

The degree of damage inflicted by X-rays is influenced by both the dose and the duration of exposure. High doses of X-rays can cause immediate cellular damage, resulting in radiation sickness. In contrast, lower doses may lead to cumulative long-term effects, which can elevate the risk of developing cancer over time.

To mitigate the harmful effects of X-rays, various safety protocols are implemented in medical environments where X-ray technology is utilized. These precautions include protective shielding, such as lead aprons and collars, designed to minimize unnecessary exposure to radiation. Additionally, X-ray machines are meticulously calibrated to ensure they deliver the lowest effective dose of radiation while still producing high-quality images.

In summary, although X-rays are an invaluable tool in medical imaging, it is crucial to use them judiciously and with appropriate safety measures to reduce the potential risks to living tissues.
