To determine the total resistance in a series DC circuit, you simply sum the individual resistances.

In a series DC circuit, resistors are connected end-to-end, allowing the current to flow sequentially through each resistor. The total resistance can be calculated using the formula:

$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots + R_n
$$

where $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, etc. represent the individual resistances.

It's important to understand that in a series circuit, the current remains constant through each resistor, while the voltage is divided among them. This means that the voltage drop across each resistor is directly proportional to its resistance. For instance, consider two resistors in series: one with a resistance of $10 \, \Omega$ and the other with a resistance of $20 \, \Omega$. In this case, the voltage across the $10 \, \Omega$ resistor will be one-third of the total voltage, while the voltage across the $20 \, \Omega$ resistor will be two-thirds of the total voltage.

Calculating the total resistance in a series DC circuit is crucial for determining both the total current and voltage within the circuit. Additionally, this calculation is useful for assessing the power dissipated by each resistor since the power dissipation is proportional to the resistance.
