Dwarf stars can be categorized into four primary types: red dwarfs, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, and yellow dwarfs.

**Red Dwarfs**  
Red dwarfs are the most prevalent variety of dwarf stars, typically possessing a mass of less than half that of the Sun. They are characterized by their low temperature and luminosity, with surface temperatures generally below $4,000$ Kelvin. Despite their diminutive size, red dwarfs have extraordinarily long lifespans, potentially lasting for trillions of years.

**White Dwarfs**  
White dwarfs represent the remnants of stars that have depleted their nuclear fuel and expelled their outer layers. These stars are remarkably dense, having a mass comparable to that of the Sun but a physical size similar to that of Earth. White dwarfs are also extremely hot, with surface temperatures reaching up to $100,000$ Kelvin.

**Brown Dwarfs**  
Brown dwarfs are often described as "failed stars" because they lack the necessary mass to initiate and sustain nuclear fusion in their cores, preventing them from becoming true stars. They fall between gas giants, such as Jupiter, and red dwarfs in size, with masses ranging from $13$ to $80$ times that of Jupiter.

**Yellow Dwarfs**  
Yellow dwarfs, like our Sun, are classified as main-sequence stars and are capable of fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. They are the most recognizable type of star, with a typical surface temperature around $5,500$ Kelvin and an estimated lifespan of about $10$ billion years.
