To accurately determine the uncertainty in a time measurement when using a stopwatch, it's essential to take into account both the resolution of the stopwatch and your reaction time.

The resolution of a stopwatch refers to the smallest time interval that it can measure. For instance, if the stopwatch has a resolution of $0.01$ seconds, this means that the smallest time interval it can record is $0.01$ seconds. Consequently, any time measurement taken with this stopwatch will inherently carry an uncertainty of ±$0.01$ seconds.

In addition to the stopwatch's resolution, your reaction time—the duration it takes for you to respond to the start and stop signals—can introduce further uncertainty into your time measurement. To gauge your reaction time, you can conduct a simple experiment in which you measure the time it takes to respond to a visual or auditory cue. Once you obtain an estimate of your reaction time, you can combine this with the uncertainty stemming from the stopwatch's resolution.

For example, if the stopwatch has a resolution of $0.01$ seconds and your estimated reaction time is $0.2$ seconds, the total uncertainty in your time measurement would be ±$0.21$ seconds. It is important to understand that this total uncertainty is an estimate and may vary based on the specific experiment and environmental conditions.
