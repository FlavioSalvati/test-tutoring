A PN junction diode is created by combining a p-type semiconductor with an n-type semiconductor, while a Schottky diode is formed by interfacing a metal with a semiconductor.

PN junction diodes are the most prevalent type of diode, widely utilized in various applications such as rectification, voltage regulation, and signal modulation. The junction of the p-type and n-type semiconductors produces a depletion region where the majority charge carriers are depleted, resulting in a potential barrier. When a forward bias is applied, this potential barrier diminishes, allowing current to flow through the diode. Conversely, when a reverse bias is applied, the potential barrier increases, effectively blocking current flow. To gain a deeper understanding of these mechanisms, exploring the underlying principles can be particularly enlightening.

Schottky diodes, often referred to as hot carrier diodes, are constructed by joining a metal with a semiconductor, which establishes a Schottky barrier at the junction. These diodes exhibit a lower forward voltage drop and faster switching speeds compared to PN junction diodes, making them ideal for high-frequency applications such as radio frequency (RF) circuits and power electronics. However, they do have a higher reverse leakage current, which limits their suitability for high-voltage applications. Schottky diodes are particularly important in applications that exploit the photoelectric effect, where the movement of electrons in response to light exposure is essential.

In summary, a PN junction diode is formed by connecting a p-type semiconductor to an n-type semiconductor, making it valuable for various electronic applications like rectifiers. On the other hand, a Schottky diode, created by connecting a metal to a semiconductor, is better suited for fast switching and high-frequency applications, though it is less effective in high-voltage scenarios due to increased reverse leakage current. Thus, their construction and optimal applications differ significantly.
