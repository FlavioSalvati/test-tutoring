Radiocarbon dating is grounded in the principle that living organisms absorb carbon-14 from the atmosphere.

This method is used to determine the age of objects containing organic material by quantifying the amount of carbon-14 they contain. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that forms in the atmosphere when cosmic rays interact with nitrogen atoms. Living organisms take in carbon-14 through processes such as photosynthesis, which leads to its incorporation into their biological tissues.

Upon an organism's death, it ceases to absorb carbon-14, and the carbon-14 present in its tissues begins to decay at a known rate. By measuring the remaining amount of carbon-14 in a sample and comparing it to the initial concentration, scientists can estimate the time elapsed since the organism's death.

Radiocarbon dating serves as a powerful tool for archaeologists and other researchers studying historical events. It can effectively date materials that are up to $50,000$ years old, including bones, wood, and charcoal. However, certain limitations exist: this method can only be applied to materials that were previously alive, and it is susceptible to contamination from other carbon sources.

In summary, radiocarbon dating is a crucial technique for understanding Earth's biological history, and it continues to undergo refinement and improvement by scientists worldwide.
