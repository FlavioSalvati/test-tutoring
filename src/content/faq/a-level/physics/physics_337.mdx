Chromatic aberration in lenses arises from the varying wavelengths of light, which refract at different angles.

When light travels through a lens, it undergoes refraction, or bending, due to the change in its speed as it passes through the lens material. However, different colors of light possess distinct wavelengths, resulting in slight variations in their angles of refraction. Consequently, the focal point for each color is not the same, leading to the phenomenon known as chromatic aberration.

There are two main types of chromatic aberration: longitudinal and transverse. 

- **Longitudinal chromatic aberration** occurs when different colors of light have different focal lengths. This discrepancy can make the image appear blurry and introduce colored fringes along the edges. 
- **Transverse chromatic aberration**, on the other hand, happens when different colors converge at different points on the image plane, resulting in a distorted image.

To mitigate chromatic aberration, lens designers often construct lenses with multiple elements made from various materials and shapes. This approach allows for more precise refraction of the different colors of light. Additionally, some lenses are treated with special coatings that minimize the reflection of light, thereby enhancing image quality.

In summary, chromatic aberration is a critical factor to consider in lens design and usage, as it can significantly affect the quality and clarity of images captured through optical systems.
