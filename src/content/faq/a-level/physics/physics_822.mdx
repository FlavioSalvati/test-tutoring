Distortion in optical systems refers to the deviation from ideal image formation, leading to various image quality issues.

This phenomenon is prevalent in optical systems and can result in images that appear distorted or blurred. There are two primary types of distortion: barrel distortion and pincushion distortion. Barrel distortion occurs when straight lines at the edges of the image bow outward, while pincushion distortion causes these lines to curve inward. Both types of distortion can arise from several factors, including the curvature of the lens or the positioning of the image sensor.

To correct distortion in an optical system, several techniques can be employed. A common approach is software correction, which applies mathematical algorithms to the image data to rectify the distortion. Another method involves the use of specialized lenses, such as fisheye lenses, which are intentionally designed to create distortion for artistic purposes. However, the most effective way to minimize distortion is to utilize high-quality lenses and to meticulously calibrate the optical system to ensure optimal performance.

In summary, distortion in optical systems is a frequent challenge that can lead to blurred or distorted images. By understanding the underlying causes of distortion and employing suitable correction techniques, one can achieve high-quality image formation.
