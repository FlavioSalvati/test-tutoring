To minimize the percentage uncertainty in an experiment, it is essential to enhance the accuracy of measurements and mitigate random errors.

Percentage uncertainty serves as an indicator of the precision of a measurement, and lowering this value can significantly improve the reliability of experimental outcomes. One effective approach to reducing percentage uncertainty is to increase the accuracy of measurements. This can be accomplished by utilizing more precise instruments, such as opting for a digital balance instead of a traditional beam balance. Additionally, taking multiple readings and calculating their average can lead to improved accuracy. Furthermore, calibrating instruments prior to use helps ensure their accuracy and reduces the occurrence of systematic errors.

Another method to decrease percentage uncertainty involves minimizing random errors. These errors arise from uncontrollable factors, such as temperature fluctuations or human mistakes. To address this, it is vital to maintain controlled experimental conditions as much as possible. This can be achieved by performing experiments in a stable environment and employing consistent techniques throughout the process. Repeating measurements is also crucial, as it allows for the identification and elimination of outliers. Understanding the distinction between systematic and random errors is important for accurately interpreting the effects of these strategies on your results.
