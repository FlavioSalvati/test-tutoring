Gay-Lussac's Law describes the relationship between the pressure and temperature of a gas when the volume is held constant. 

According to Gay-Lussac's Law, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature when the volume does not change. This means that an increase in the temperature of a gas results in an increase in its pressure, and conversely, a decrease in temperature leads to a decrease in pressure. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{P}{T} = k
$$

where $P$ represents the pressure, $T$ denotes the absolute temperature (measured in Kelvin), and $k$ is a constant.

To apply Gay-Lussac's Law in gas-related problems, you need to know the initial pressure and temperature of the gas, as well as either the final temperature or the final pressure. The relationship can be utilized with the equation:

$$
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
$$

to solve for the unknown variable.

For instance, consider a scenario where a gas has an initial pressure of $1 \text{ atm}$ and an initial temperature of $273 \text{ K}$. If this gas is heated to a final temperature of $373 \text{ K}$, we can use Gay-Lussac's Law to determine the final pressure. By rearranging the equation to solve for $P_2$, we find:

$$
P_2 = P_1 \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) = 1 \text{ atm} \left(\frac{373 \text{ K}}{273 \text{ K}}\right) \approx 1.36 \text{ atm}.
$$

Gay-Lussac's Law is particularly valuable for understanding gas behavior under various conditions, such as within engines or in the atmosphere. Additionally, it can be integrated with other gas laws, like Boyle's Law and Charles's Law, to tackle more complex gas-related problems.
