Radiation plays a crucial role in food preservation by eliminating microorganisms that lead to spoilage and disease.

The preservation of food through radiation involves exposing it to ionizing radiation, which effectively kills various microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi responsible for food spoilage and illness. This process damages the DNA of these microorganisms, thereby inhibiting their ability to reproduce. The most commonly utilized sources of ionizing radiation for food preservation include gamma rays and electron beams.

Gamma rays are generated from the decay of radioactive isotopes, such as cobalt-60 or cesium-137. These isotopes are stored within shielded containers, allowing the emitted gamma rays to be directed towards the food intended for preservation. Conversely, electron beams are created by accelerating electrons to high speeds and directing them at the food. Both gamma rays and electron beams possess high penetrating power, enabling them to treat large quantities of food rapidly and efficiently.

Radiation can be employed to preserve a wide array of food items, including fruits, vegetables, meats, and spices. Additionally, it is effective for sterilizing food packaging materials, such as plastics and metals. The application of radiation for food preservation is strictly regulated by national and international bodies, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to ensure its safety and efficacy.

In summary, radiation serves as a powerful method for food preservation, aiding in the reduction of food waste and enhancing food safety. Although some concerns exist regarding the safety of irradiated food, extensive studies have indicated that it is safe for human consumption and does not pose any harmful effects.
