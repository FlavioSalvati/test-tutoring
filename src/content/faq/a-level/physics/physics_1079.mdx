A nuclear power plant generates electricity through the use of nuclear reactions that produce heat. 

Within the plant, uranium atoms undergo a process known as nuclear fission, where they are split apart. This reaction releases a significant amount of energy in the form of heat. The generated heat is then utilized to produce steam, which drives a turbine connected to an electricity generator. The generator converts the kinetic energy of the turbine into electrical energy, subsequently supplying it to the power grid.

To ensure the nuclear fission process is controlled, the plant employs control rods made from materials such as boron or cadmium. These rods absorb neutrons, effectively slowing down the fission reaction. This regulation allows plant operators to manage the amount of heat produced, thereby preventing uncontrolled reactions.

The nuclear fuel used in these power plants is typically enriched uranium. Enrichment increases the concentration of the isotope uranium-235, making it more reactive. The fuel is housed in fuel rods, which are placed inside a reactor vessel filled with water. This water serves as a coolant, absorbing the heat generated by the nuclear reactions and transferring it away from the reactor.

Nuclear power plants are equipped with multiple layers of safety systems designed to prevent accidents and protect the environment. These safety measures include physical barriers to contain the fuel, emergency cooling systems, and backup power supplies to maintain operations in the event of a loss of external power. Despite the implementation of these safety protocols, nuclear power remains a contentious issue due to concerns about the potential for accidents and the long-term management of radioactive waste.
