The induced electromotive force (EMF) is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux.

When a conductor moves through a magnetic field, or when the magnetic field changes around a stationary conductor, an EMF is induced within that conductor. The magnitude of this induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate at which magnetic flux changes. This principle is articulated in Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.

Magnetic flux, denoted as $\Phi$, is defined as the product of the magnetic field strength, $B$, and the area, $A$, that is perpendicular to the field. Thus, we can express magnetic flux mathematically as:

$$
\Phi = B \cdot A
$$

The rate of change of magnetic flux is expressed as the change in magnetic flux over time, represented by $\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$. This change can occur due to several factors: a variation in the strength of the magnetic field, a change in the area of the conductor that is perpendicular to the field, or an alteration in the angle between the conductor and the magnetic field.

The induced EMF can be calculated with the following equation:

$$
\text{EMF} = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt}
$$

In this expression, EMF represents the induced electromotive force, $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux, and $t$ denotes time. The negative sign in the equation signifies that the induced EMF opposes the change in magnetic flux, in accordance with Lenz's law.

This relationship is fundamental in various practical applications, particularly in devices such as generators and transformers. By manipulating the rate of change of magnetic flux, one can control the induced EMF to achieve a desired output voltage or current. A thorough understanding of the relationship between magnetic flux and induced EMF is essential for the study of electromagnetism.
