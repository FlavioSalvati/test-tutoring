Collimation plays a vital role in X-ray imaging by minimizing scattered radiation and enhancing image quality.

When X-rays traverse an object, they interact with the atoms within and generate scattered radiation. This scattering can diminish the contrast and resolution of the resulting image. Collimation is the technique employed to confine the X-ray beam to the specific area of interest, thereby reducing the amount of scattered radiation and improving the overall image quality.

Collimators are specialized devices positioned between the X-ray source and the patient to shape and restrict the X-ray beam. These devices can be adjustable, allowing them to conform to the size and shape of the area being imaged, or they can be fixed to a predetermined size and shape.

Beyond enhancing image quality, collimation also contributes to lowering the radiation dose received by both the patient and the operator. By focusing the X-ray beam on only the necessary area, the overall radiation exposure is minimized, which increases the safety of the procedure for everyone involved.

It is essential to implement proper collimation techniques in X-ray imaging to ensure accurate diagnoses and maintain safe levels of radiation exposure. A-Level Physics students should grasp the principles of collimation and recognize its significance in the field of medical imaging.
