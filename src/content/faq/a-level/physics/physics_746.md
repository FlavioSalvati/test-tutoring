Dark matter is fundamental to the formation and stability of galaxies.

Galaxies form through the gravitational collapse of gas and dust. However, there is a significant discrepancy between the observed mass of galaxies and the mass of their visible matter. This difference is attributed to dark matter, which is believed to constitute approximately $85\%$ of the total matter in the universe.

Dark matter exerts the gravitational force necessary to maintain the integrity of galaxies. Without its influence, the rotational speeds of stars in the outer regions of galaxies would be excessively high, resulting in these stars being ejected into space. Furthermore, dark matter plays a crucial role in shaping the distribution of visible matter within galaxies. It exerts a gravitational pull on gas and dust, leading to their clumping and, ultimately, the formation of stars.

While the precise nature of dark matter remains elusive, it is hypothesized to consist of particles that do not interact with light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. This characteristic makes direct detection challenging, but we can infer its presence through its gravitational effects on visible matter.

In conclusion, dark matter is essential for both the formation and stability of galaxies. Its gravitational influence not only binds galaxies together but also significantly affects the distribution of visible matter, facilitating the formation of stars and various structures within galaxies.
