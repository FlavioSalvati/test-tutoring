An electron microscope employs a beam of electrons to magnify objects, producing high-resolution images that reveal intricate details.

Unlike traditional light microscopes, which utilize visible light to form images, electron microscopes harness electrons generated by an electron gun. These electrons are precisely focused onto the specimen using magnetic lenses. To ensure the clarity of the image, the sample is placed in a vacuum, which prevents the scattering of electrons that could distort the resulting image.

There are two primary types of electron microscopes: Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM). 

- **Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEM)** utilize thin samples that permit electrons to pass through, thereby creating images that illustrate the internal structure of the specimen.
  
- **Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM)**, on the other hand, employ a focused beam of electrons to scan the surface of a sample, generating three-dimensional images that capture surface details.

Electron microscopes are capable of achieving significantly higher resolutions compared to light microscopes, making them invaluable for observing minuscule structures. The resolution of an electron microscope is fundamentally limited by the wavelength of the electrons, which is considerably shorter than that of visible light. As a result, electron microscopes can reach resolutions as fine as $0.1$ nanometers, enabling the visualization of individual atoms.

These powerful instruments find applications across a wide range of disciplines, including materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. They have fundamentally transformed our understanding of the microscopic realm and remain a crucial tool in advancing scientific research.
