The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) serves as compelling evidence for the Big Bang theory.

The CMB is a faint glow of light that permeates the entire universe. Discovered in 1964 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, this radiation earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics for their groundbreaking work. The CMB is believed to be the afterglow of the Big Bang, which occurred roughly $13.8$ billion years ago.

Understanding the Big Bang is significantly enhanced by studying the CMB. It exhibits an almost perfect uniformity in all directions, with only minute variations in temperature. These slight fluctuations are thought to arise from tiny differences in matter density during the early universe. Over time, these fluctuations grew into the galaxies and clusters of galaxies that we observe today.

Moreover, the CMB provides a valuable snapshot of the early universe. Its temperature is approximately $2.7$ Kelvin, which is extremely cold. This temperature corresponds to a period when the universe was merely $380,000$ years old. Prior to this time, the universe was too hot and dense for light to travel freely. Thus, the CMB acts as a window into the universe's infancy, enabling us to study its properties and evolution.

In summary, the cosmic microwave background radiation is a crucial piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory. Its uniformity and temperature offer a glimpse into the early universe, while its fluctuations reveal insights into the formation of cosmic structures.
