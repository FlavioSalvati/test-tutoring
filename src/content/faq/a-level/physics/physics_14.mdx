The wavelength of a wave is defined as the distance between two consecutive points on the wave that are in phase. 

In physics, a wave represents a disturbance that propagates through space and time, carrying energy along with it. Waves can be categorized into two primary types: transverse waves and longitudinal waves. In a transverse wave, the displacement of the medium occurs perpendicular to the direction in which the wave travels. Conversely, in a longitudinal wave, the displacement of the medium is parallel to the direction of wave propagation.

To elaborate further, the wavelength is specifically the distance between two points on the wave that are at the same stage in their cycle. For instance, in a transverse wave, the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive crests or two consecutive troughs. In the case of a longitudinal wave, it is the distance between two consecutive compressions or two consecutive rarefactions.

The wavelength is intrinsically linked to the wave's frequency and speed. The frequency of a wave, measured in hertz (Hz), indicates the number of complete cycles that pass a given point in one second. The speed of a wave is the distance it travels per second. The relationship among wavelength ($\lambda$), speed ($v$), and frequency ($f$) can be expressed with the formula:

$$
\lambda = \frac{v}{f}
$$

This relationship implies that if the frequency of a wave increases, its wavelength will decrease, and vice versa. Similarly, if the speed of a wave increases, its wavelength will also increase, and again, vice versa.
