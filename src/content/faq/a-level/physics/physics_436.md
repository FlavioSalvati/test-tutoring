To determine the speed of an object in circular motion, you can use the formula 

$$
v = r \omega.
$$

**Understanding Circular Motion**

Circular motion refers to the movement of an object along a circular path. The speed of an object in this type of motion is defined as the distance it travels along the circumference of the circle within a specified time interval. The aforementioned formula effectively calculates this speed, where:

- \( v \) represents the speed,
- \( r \) denotes the radius of the circle, and
- \( \omega \) is the angular velocity.

**What is Angular Velocity?**

Angular velocity quantifies the rate at which an object rotates around a fixed axis. It is expressed in radians per second (rad/s). To find the angular velocity, you can use the formula 

$$
\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t},
$$

where \( \Delta \theta \) is the change in angle (in radians) and \( \Delta t \) is the change in time (in seconds).

**Calculating Speed from Angular Velocity**

Once you have determined the angular velocity, you can easily calculate the speed using the formula 

$$
v = r \omega.$$

For instance, consider an object moving in a circle with a radius of $2$ meters and an angular velocity of $3$ radians per second. The speed of the object would be computed as follows:

$$
v = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ meters per second}.
$$

**Key Considerations**

It is crucial to understand that the speed of an object in circular motion remains constant only when both the radius and angular velocity stay unchanged. If either the radius \( r \) or the angular velocity \( \omega \) varies, the speed \( v \) of the object will also change accordingly.
