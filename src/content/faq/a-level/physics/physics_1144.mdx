The energy of X-rays is quantified using a device known as a spectrometer.

X-rays represent a type of electromagnetic radiation characterized by high energy and short wavelengths. To measure the energy of X-rays, a spectrometer is employed, which separates the X-rays into various wavelengths and assesses their intensity. The spectrometer is equipped with a crystal that diffracts the X-rays, generating a pattern of bright spots on a detector. The locations of these spots correspond to the different wavelengths of the emitted X-rays.

The energy of X-rays is inversely proportional to their wavelength, meaning that shorter wavelengths correspond to higher energies. By analyzing the positions of the bright spots on the detector, the energy of the X-rays can be accurately determined. This process involves comparing the positions of the observed X-ray peaks with the established positions of peaks produced by a calibration source that emits X-rays of known energies.

The energy of X-rays is generally expressed in electron volts (eV), a unit of energy frequently used in atomic and nuclear physics. The energy values for X-rays can range from a few hundred eV to several million eV, depending on their source and the specific conditions under which they are generated.

In summary, the energy of X-rays is measured using a spectrometer that separates the X-rays into different wavelengths and measures their intensity. The energy is then determined by correlating the measured wavelengths with those of a calibration source that has known energy values.
