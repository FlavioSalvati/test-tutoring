The principle of fatigue in materials refers to the weakening or eventual failure of a material when subjected to cyclic loading.

When a material undergoes repeated cycles of loading and unloading, it may ultimately fail, even when the applied stress remains below the material's yield strength. This phenomenon is known as fatigue. The repeated loading leads to the formation of microscopic cracks within the material, which can grow over time and ultimately result in failure. The number of cycles required to induce failure varies based on the specific material and the magnitude of the applied stress.

Fatigue presents a significant challenge in various engineering applications, especially in structures that experience cyclic loading, such as aircraft wings and bridges. To mitigate the risk of fatigue failure, engineers must meticulously design structures to endure the anticipated cyclic loads. They often opt for materials that exhibit enhanced resistance to fatigue, such as specially formulated alloys designed for high-cycle fatigue applications.

In addition to structural design considerations, engineers can employ non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques to identify cracks before they grow large enough to lead to failure. Common NDT methods include ultrasonic testing and X-ray inspection. By detecting cracks at an early stage, engineers can take proactive measures to repair or replace affected components, thereby ensuring the safety and reliability of the structure.
