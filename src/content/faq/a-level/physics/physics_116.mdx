An electric field can exert a force on a moving charge, thereby altering its trajectory.

When a charged particle traverses an electric field, it experiences a force that is perpendicular to both its direction of motion and the direction of the electric field. This force can induce changes in the particle's direction, speed it up, slow it down, or even bring it to a halt. The magnitude of this force is directly proportional to both the charge of the particle and the strength of the electric field.

In the case of a uniform electric field, the particle will maintain a straight-line motion at a constant speed. Conversely, in a non-uniform electric field, the particle will encounter a net force that leads to its acceleration. This acceleration can result in complex motion, with the particle following a curved trajectory or even spiraling toward or away from the source of the electric field.

The interaction between electric fields and moving charges is a fundamental aspect of numerous fields in physics, including electronics, electromagnetism, and particle physics. A thorough understanding of how charged particles behave in electric fields is essential for the design and operation of various devices, such as electric motors, generators, and particle accelerators.
