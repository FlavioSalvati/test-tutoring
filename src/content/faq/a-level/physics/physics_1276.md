The velocity of an object undergoing simple harmonic motion (SHM) can be determined using the equation:

$$
v = \pm \omega \sqrt{A^2 - x^2}
$$

In simple harmonic motion, the restoring force acting on the object is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position. This means that the farther the object is from equilibrium, the stronger the force that pulls it back toward that position. As a result, the object oscillates or vibrates around the equilibrium point.

The velocity of an object in SHM continuously changes as it moves back and forth. At the equilibrium position, the velocity reaches its maximum value, while at the points of maximum displacement (the amplitude), the velocity is zero. The sign of the velocity indicates the direction of motion: it is positive when the object is moving toward the equilibrium position and negative when it is moving away from it.

The equation for the velocity of an object in simple harmonic motion is given by:

$$
v = \pm \omega \sqrt{A^2 - x^2}
$$

In this expression:
- $v$ represents the velocity of the object,
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency,
- $A$ denotes the amplitude (the maximum displacement from equilibrium),
- $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position at any specific time.

The $\pm$ sign in the equation signifies that the velocity can be either positive or negative, depending on the object's direction of motion.

In summary, the velocity of an object in simple harmonic motion can be calculated using the formula:

$$
v = \pm \omega \sqrt{A^2 - x^2}
$$

This equation incorporates both the amplitude and the instantaneous displacement from equilibrium, providing a complete description of the object's motion at any given moment.
