Avogadro's Law asserts that equal volumes of gases, when measured at the same temperature and pressure, contain an equal number of particles.

To apply Avogadro's Law in gas-related problems, we utilize the relationship expressed by the formula 

$$
\frac{V_1}{n_1} = \frac{V_2}{n_2}
$$

where \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \) represent the initial and final volumes of the gas, respectively, and \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) denote the initial and final number of particles. This formula allows us to calculate the final volume or the number of particles when the initial volume or number of particles is provided, or vice versa.

For instance, consider a gas with an initial volume of $2.5 \, \text{L}$ and $3.5$ moles of particles. If we aim to determine the final volume after increasing the number of particles to $5.0$ moles, we can apply Avogadro's Law. By rearranging the formula to solve for \( V_2 \), we have:

$$
V_2 = \left( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \right) \times V_1 = \left( \frac{5.0}{3.5} \right) \times 2.5 = 3.57 \, \text{L}.
$$

Avogadro's Law is also instrumental in calculating the molar mass of a gas. By measuring the mass of a gas sample along with its volume, we can determine the number of moles of particles using the ideal gas law, given by the equation 

$$
PV = nRT,
$$ 

where \( P \) is the pressure, \( V \) is the volume, \( n \) is the number of moles, \( R \) is the ideal gas constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Subsequently, by dividing the mass of the gas by the number of moles, we can derive the molar mass of the gas.

In conclusion, Avogadro's Law serves as a valuable tool for solving gas-related problems, particularly in understanding the relationship between volume and the number of particles.
