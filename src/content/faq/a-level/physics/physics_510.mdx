To determine the specific heat capacity of a substance, we can employ the equation 

$$
Q = mc\Delta T 
$$ 

alongside a calorimeter to assess the amount of heat absorbed.

Specific heat capacity is defined as the quantity of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one kilogram of a material by one degree Celsius. It is expressed in joules per kilogram per degree Celsius (J/kg°C). A calorimeter is utilized to measure the heat absorbed by a substance when its temperature is increased.

The formula 

$$
Q = mc\Delta T 
$$ 

is fundamental for calculating the heat absorbed by a substance. In this equation, $Q$ represents the heat energy absorbed, $m$ denotes the mass of the substance, $c$ is the specific heat capacity of the substance, and $\Delta T$ indicates the change in temperature.

To measure the specific heat capacity, a known mass of the substance is heated and subsequently placed in a calorimeter containing a known mass of water. By measuring the initial and final temperatures of the water, we can calculate the heat absorbed by the water using 

$$
Q = mc\Delta T 
$$ 

Next, the heat absorbed by the substance can be determined by subtracting the heat absorbed by the water from the total heat supplied.

By measuring the mass of the substance, the mass of the water, and the change in temperature of the water, we can compute the specific heat capacity of the substance using the equation 

$$
c = \frac{Q}{m\Delta T} 
$$ 

This methodology is applicable for measuring the specific heat capacity of solids, liquids, and gases.
