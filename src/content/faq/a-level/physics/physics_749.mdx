Semiconductors can be classified into two main categories: intrinsic and extrinsic.

**Intrinsic Semiconductors** are pure materials, such as silicon ($Si$) or germanium ($Ge$), that possess an equal number of electrons and holes. At room temperature, these materials exhibit a limited number of free electrons and holes. However, when the temperature increases, more electrons gain sufficient energy to transition into the conduction band, thereby enhancing the material's conductivity.

**Extrinsic Semiconductors**, on the other hand, are deliberately doped with impurities to improve their conductivity. There are two types of extrinsic semiconductors:

- **N-type Semiconductors**: These contain dopants such as phosphorus ($P$) or arsenic ($As$), which introduce additional electrons that are free to move within the material.
  
- **P-type Semiconductors**: These are doped with elements like boron ($B$) or aluminum ($Al$), which have fewer valence electrons compared to silicon. This creates "holes" that can facilitate the movement of charge.

When an N-type semiconductor is placed in contact with a P-type semiconductor, a **p-n junction** is formed. This junction establishes a depletion region, an area devoid of free electrons and holes. When a voltage is applied across this junction, the depletion region narrows, allowing electrons and holes to flow across the junction, thus generating an electric current.

Semiconductors play a vital role in a wide array of electronic devices, including transistors, diodes, and solar cells. A solid understanding of the different types of semiconductors and their operational principles is essential for advancing new technologies.
