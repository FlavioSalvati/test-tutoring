Particle decay refers to the transformation of a particle into one or more other particles. This phenomenon occurs primarily due to the instability of certain particles, which may possess excess energy or are not in their most stable, lowest energy state. As a result, these particles can undergo spontaneous decay, during which they emit other particles. Additionally, decay can also be triggered by external influences, such as collisions with other particles or exposure to high-energy radiation.

There are several distinct types of particle decay, including alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay:

1. **Alpha Decay**: In this process, a nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. Consequently, the original nucleus transforms into a new nucleus with a lower atomic number.

2. **Beta Decay**: This type of decay involves the transformation of a neutron within the nucleus into a proton. During this process, an electron (or positron) is emitted, resulting in a change in the atomic number of the nucleus.

3. **Gamma Decay**: This occurs when an excited nucleus releases energy in the form of a gamma ray, which is a high-energy photon. This emission helps the nucleus transition to a lower energy state.

Particle decay is a fundamental concept in both nuclear physics and particle physics, as it enables scientists to investigate the properties and interactions of various particles. Furthermore, an understanding of particle decay is essential in practical applications, such as medical imaging, where gamma rays are utilized in techniques like Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans.
