Wave motion refers to the transfer of energy through oscillations in a medium.

Wave motion is a fundamental concept in physics that describes how energy is transmitted through a medium. Waves can be classified into two primary types: transverse waves and longitudinal waves. Transverse waves exhibit oscillations that are perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, while longitudinal waves display oscillations that occur parallel to the direction of wave travel.

One of the key properties of waves is the wavelength, defined as the distance between two consecutive points on a wave that are in phase. Another significant property is frequency, which measures the number of oscillations per unit time. These two properties are interconnected through the wave speed, which represents the rate at which the wave propagates through the medium.

Wave motion plays a crucial role in various fields of physics, including optics, acoustics, and electromagnetism. In optics, wave motion is used to explain the behavior of light, whereas in acoustics, it describes the behavior of sound. In the realm of electromagnetism, wave motion is instrumental in understanding electromagnetic radiation, such as radio waves and microwaves.

In summary, wave motion is an essential concept in physics, vital for comprehending many phenomena observed in the natural world.
