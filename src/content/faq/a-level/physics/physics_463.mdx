The principles of stress and strain in materials are fundamental concepts that describe how materials deform when subjected to external forces.

When a force is applied to a material, it results in deformation. The extent of this deformation depends on both the properties of the material and the magnitude of the applied force. Stress is mathematically defined as the force per unit area, expressed in pascals (Pa), while strain is defined as the change in length relative to the original length, making it a dimensionless quantity.

The relationship between stress and strain is illustrated by the material's stress-strain curve. This curve provides insight into how a material responds to increasing levels of stress and can be instrumental in determining key properties such as the material's elastic modulus, yield strength, and ultimate strength.

Elastic deformation occurs when a material returns to its original shape after the applied force is removed. In contrast, plastic deformation occurs when the material does not revert to its original shape, indicating that permanent deformation has taken place. The transition point at which plastic deformation begins is referred to as the yield point.

Understanding the principles of stress and strain is crucial in engineering. This knowledge enables engineers to design structures and materials capable of withstanding external forces without failure. By comprehending material properties and their responses to stress and strain, engineers can create safer and more efficient structures.
