A field-effect transistor (FET) is a type of transistor that utilizes an electric field to regulate the flow of current through a semiconductor channel. 

The structure of a FET consists of three terminals: the source, the drain, and the gate. The source and drain are connected to the semiconductor channel, which is typically composed of silicon. The gate terminal is separated from the semiconductor channel by a thin insulating layer, commonly made of silicon dioxide.

When a voltage is applied to the gate, an electric field is generated in the insulating layer, which in turn induces an electric field within the semiconductor channel. This electric field plays a crucial role in controlling the current flow through the channel. Specifically, when the voltage at the gate is positive, it attracts electrons from the semiconductor channel, resulting in the formation of a depletion region near the gate. This depletion region effectively reduces the current flow through the channel. Conversely, when the gate voltage is negative, it repels electrons from the semiconductor channel, leading to the creation of an inversion layer near the gate. This inversion layer enhances the current flow through the channel.

FETs offer several advantages over other transistor types, including high input impedance, low noise, and low power consumption. Due to these benefits, they are widely used in various applications such as amplifiers, switches, and digital circuits.
