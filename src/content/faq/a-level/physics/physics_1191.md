We report uncertainties in measurements to convey the range of possible values for the measured quantity. 

Measurements are inherently imprecise due to the limitations of both the measuring instruments and the methods employed. Uncertainties represent the range within which the true value of the quantity being measured is likely to fall. It is crucial to report these uncertainties, as they help others interpret the limitations of the measurement and enable comparisons with other measurements.

There are two primary types of uncertainties: random and systematic. 

- **Random uncertainties** stem from inherent limitations in the measuring instrument and the methodology used. These uncertainties can be minimized by taking multiple measurements and calculating the standard deviation. 
- **Systematic uncertainties**, on the other hand, arise from flaws in the measuring instrument or the measurement process itself. These can only be mitigated by improving the instrument or the measurement technique.

Uncertainties are typically reported in the following format: measured value Â± uncertainty. The uncertainty is often expressed as a percentage of the measured value. For instance, if the measured value is $10.0 \pm 0.1 \, \text{cm}$, the uncertainty is $1\%$. Additionally, the uncertainty can be represented as a range of values, such as from $9.9 \, \text{cm}$ to $10.1 \, \text{cm}$.

In conclusion, reporting uncertainties in measurements is essential as it helps others grasp the limitations of the measurement and facilitates comparisons with other data. Understanding that uncertainties can be either random or systematic is vital, and adhering to a specific reporting format enhances clarity and communication.
