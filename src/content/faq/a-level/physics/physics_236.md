The electric field intensity is determined by dividing the force experienced by a test charge by the magnitude of that charge.

To compute the electric field intensity at a specific point in space, it is essential to know the electric charge that generates the field and the distance from that charge to the point of interest. Electric field intensity is a vector quantity, which means it possesses both magnitude and direction. The direction of the electric field indicates the path a positive test charge would take if placed in the field.

The mathematical expression for electric field intensity is given by 

$$
E = \frac{F}{Q}
$$ 

where $E$ represents the electric field intensity, $F$ denotes the force experienced by the test charge, and $Q$ is the magnitude of that test charge. The SI unit for electric field intensity is newtons per coulomb (N/C).

Additionally, electric field intensity can be calculated using Coulomb's law, which states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their magnitudes and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. By rearranging this law, we can derive the electric field intensity at a given point in space.

In summary, electric field intensity quantifies the strength of an electric field at a specific location. It can be calculated by dividing the force experienced by a test charge by the magnitude of that charge, and it can also be derived from Coulomb's law.
