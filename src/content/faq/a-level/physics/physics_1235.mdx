Thermal stress refers to the stress induced in a material due to variations in temperature. This phenomenon can be quantitatively assessed using the coefficient of thermal expansion.

When a material experiences changes in temperature, it either expands or contracts in response, which is determined by its coefficient of thermal expansion. This resultant expansion or contraction generates internal stresses within the material, known as thermal stress. The magnitude of thermal stress is influenced by the degree of temperature change as well as the specific coefficient of thermal expansion of the material in question.

The coefficient of thermal expansion quantifies how much a material will expand or contract when subjected to a change in temperature. It is typically expressed as a fractional change in length or volume per degree Celsius. This coefficient can be determined through experimental methods or sourced from established reference tables.

To calculate thermal stress, it is essential to know both the change in temperature and the coefficient of thermal expansion for the material. The formula for determining thermal stress is given by:

$$
\text{Thermal Stress} = \text{Coefficient of Thermal Expansion} \times \text{Change in Temperature} \times \text{Young's Modulus}
$$

Here, Young's modulus serves as a measure of a material's stiffness or elasticity. It is a fundamental constant that relates the applied stress to the resulting strain within the material. The units of thermal stress are commonly expressed in N/mÂ² (newtons per square meter) or Pa (pascals).

In summary, thermal stress arises from temperature fluctuations within a material, and it can be calculated using the coefficient of thermal expansion, the change in temperature, and Young's modulus.
