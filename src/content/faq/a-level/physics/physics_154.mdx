Alternating current (AC) is a type of electrical current that periodically reverses its direction.

AC is the primary form of current used in homes and businesses to power various appliances and electronic devices. It is generated by machines known as generators, which utilize rotating magnets to create a changing magnetic field. As these magnets rotate, the magnetic field alternates, causing electrons in the conducting wire to move back and forth in a cyclical pattern. This back-and-forth movement results in a current that periodically reverses direction, hence the name "alternating current."

One of the significant advantages of AC compared to direct current (DC) is its ability to be easily transformed to different voltage levels using a transformer. This property enables the efficient transmission of electricity over long distances with minimal power loss. Additionally, AC is generally safer than DC because it can be interrupted simply by a switch or circuit breaker. In contrast, DC can continue to flow even after a switch is turned off, posing potential hazards.

Despite its advantages, AC does have some drawbacks. It can cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) in electronic devices, leading to noise and distortion. Furthermore, converting AC to DC for use in electronic devices requires more complex circuitry. Nevertheless, AC continues to be the dominant form of electrical power used globally today.
