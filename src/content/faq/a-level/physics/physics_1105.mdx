Angular displacement is defined as the angle through which an object rotates from its initial position.

In the context of circular motion, an object travels along a circular path with a fixed radius. The angular displacement, denoted by the symbol $\theta$, represents the angle formed between the initial and final positions of the object. This angle is measured in radians.

To determine the angular displacement, one must identify the initial and final positions of the object. The initial position serves as the reference point, and the angular displacement is calculated as the angle between this reference point and the final position.

The angular displacement can be either positive or negative, depending on the direction of rotation. If the object rotates in a clockwise direction, the angular displacement is considered negative. Conversely, if the object rotates in an anti-clockwise direction, the angular displacement is positive.

There is a relationship between angular displacement and linear displacement, described by the formula:

$$
\theta = \frac{s}{r}
$$

In this formula, $s$ represents the linear displacement, and $r$ is the radius of the circular path. This relationship arises from the fact that the arc length of a circle is directly proportional to the angle it subtends at the center.

In summary, angular displacement quantifies the angle through which an object rotates in circular motion. It is measured in radians and can take on positive or negative values based on the direction of rotation. The relationship between angular displacement and linear displacement is articulated by the formula $\theta = \frac{s}{r}$.
