To calculate magnification in optics, you need to divide the size of the image by the size of the object.

Magnification serves as a metric to indicate how much larger an image appears in comparison to the object being observed. It is determined by the ratio of the image size to the object size. In optical systems, this process typically involves the use of lenses or mirrors.

When using lenses, magnification can be calculated using the formula:

$$
M = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}
$$

In this equation, $M$ represents the magnification, $d_i$ is the image distance, and $d_o$ is the object distance. The negative sign in the formula signifies that the image produced is inverted relative to the object.

For mirrors, the magnification is calculated with the following formula:

$$
M = \frac{h_i}{h_o}
$$

In this case, $h_i$ denotes the height of the image, while $h_o$ represents the height of the object. This formula is applicable to both concave and convex mirrors.

It is essential to keep in mind that magnification is a dimensionless quantity; it does not possess physical units. Instead, it is simply a ratio of sizes. Additionally, magnification can be expressed as a percentage by multiplying the ratio by 100%.

Beyond the calculation of magnification, it is crucial to consider the focal length of the lens or mirror in use. The focal length influences the extent of light bending and, consequently, affects both the size and position of the resulting image.
