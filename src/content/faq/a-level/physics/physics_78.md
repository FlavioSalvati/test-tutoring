The units of stress are expressed in Newtons per square meter, denoted as $N/m²$, or in Pascals (Pa).

Stress is defined as the force exerted per unit area on a material. It quantifies the internal forces that resist deformation within the material. The SI unit for force is the Newton ($N$), and the SI unit for area is the square meter ($m²$). Consequently, the SI unit for stress is $N/m²$, which is also referred to as the Pascal (Pa), in honor of the French mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal.

In various contexts, different units of stress may be employed. For example, in engineering applications, stress is often measured in pounds per square inch (psi) or kilopounds per square inch (ksi). In the field of geology, stress is typically expressed in bars or megapascals (MPa).

It is essential to understand that stress and pressure, although they share the same units, are distinct concepts. Pressure refers to the force per unit area acting on a surface, while stress denotes the force per unit area acting within the material itself.
