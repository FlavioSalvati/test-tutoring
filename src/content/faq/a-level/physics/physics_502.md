To calculate the period of a satellite in circular orbit, you can use the formula:

$$ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}} $$

Here, $T$ represents the orbital period in seconds, $r$ is the radius of the orbit in meters, $G$ is the gravitational constant, which is approximately $6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$, and $M$ is the mass of the planet in kilograms.

The period of a satellite in circular orbit refers to the time it takes for the satellite to complete one full orbit around the planet. To use this formula effectively, you need to first determine the radius of the orbit and the mass of the planet. 

The radius can either be provided in the problem statement or can be calculated by adding the altitude of the satellite above the planet's surface to the planet's radius. The mass of the planet can also be given directly or obtained from reliable sources.

Once you have both the radius and mass, substitute these values into the formula to solve for $T$. It is crucial to ensure that you use consistent units for each variable to obtain the correct result, which will be expressed in seconds.

It's important to note that this formula is applicable only for circular orbits. For elliptical orbits, a different formula is required. Additionally, this formula assumes that the satellite is moving in a vacuum, with no other forces acting upon it. In practical scenarios, factors such as atmospheric drag and other forces can influence the satellite's orbital period.

### Summary for A-Level Physics Students:
To determine how long it takes for a satellite to orbit a planet in a circular path, utilize the formula:

$$ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}} $$

This requires the radius of the orbit ($r$), the gravitational constant ($G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$), and the mass of the planet ($M$). Keep in mind that this formula is valid only for circular orbits and assumes that there are no external forces, such as air resistance, affecting the satellite's motion.
