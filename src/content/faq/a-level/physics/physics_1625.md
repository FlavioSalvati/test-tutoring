To determine the average power in an alternating current (AC) circuit, we utilize the formula:

$$
P = V_{\text{rms}} I_{\text{rms}} \cos \theta
$$

In an AC circuit, both voltage and current continuously vary in both direction and magnitude. Consequently, the instantaneous power also fluctuates over time. To obtain the average power, we must calculate the mean of the instantaneous power over one complete cycle of the waveform.

The average power is expressed as:

$$
P = V_{\text{rms}} I_{\text{rms}} \cos \theta
$$

In this equation, $V_{\text{rms}}$ denotes the root-mean-square voltage, $I_{\text{rms}}$ represents the root-mean-square current, and $\theta$ signifies the phase angle between the voltage and current waveforms.

The root-mean-square (rms) values for voltage and current are employed because they reflect the equivalent direct current (DC) values that would yield the same heating effect in a resistive load. The phase angle $\theta$ indicates the phase difference between the voltage and current, which can be categorized as either leading or lagging.

To compute the average power, it is essential to measure the rms values of voltage and current using instruments such as an oscilloscope or a multimeter. Additionally, the phase angle between the voltage and current must be determined, typically with the help of a phase meter.

Once we have gathered these measurements, we can substitute them into the formula:

$$
P = V_{\text{rms}} I_{\text{rms}} \cos \theta
$$

This calculated value represents the average rate at which energy is transferred from the source to the load over one cycle, providing a clear understanding of the circuit's performance.
