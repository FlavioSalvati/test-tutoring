Speed and velocity are fundamental concepts in physics that describe motion, but they differ in important ways.

**Speed** is a scalar quantity that indicates how fast an object is moving, measured without regard for direction. It is defined as the rate at which an object covers distance, typically expressed in units such as metres per second ($\text{m/s}$) or kilometres per hour ($\text{km/h}$). For instance, if a car is traveling at a speed of $100 \, \text{km/h}$, we know the rate of motion, but we do not have information about the direction of travel.

Conversely, **velocity** is a vector quantity that provides information about both the speed and the direction of an object's motion. It represents the rate at which an object changes its position in a specified direction, also measured in units such as metres per second ($\text{m/s}$) or kilometres per hour ($\text{km/h}$). For example, if a car is moving at a velocity of $100 \, \text{km/h}$ north, we have a complete understanding of how fast the car is going and the direction it is heading.

One critical distinction between speed and velocity is that speed can remain constant while velocity can change. This occurs because velocity encompasses directional information; if an object changes its direction of motion, its velocity changes even if its speed remains unchanged. 

In summary, speed is a scalar quantity that quantifies how fast an object moves, while velocity is a vector quantity that describes how fast and in which direction an object moves. Velocity incorporates both speed and direction, whereas speed solely measures the rate of motion.
