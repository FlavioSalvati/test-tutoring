Circular motion refers to the movement of an object along a circular path.

In this type of motion, an object travels in a circular trajectory, with its direction constantly changing while maintaining a fixed distance from the center of the circle. Circular motion is commonly observed in everyday life, such as when a car navigates a roundabout or when a planet orbits a star.

There are two primary forces that play a role in circular motion: centripetal force and centrifugal force. The centripetal force acts inward toward the center of the circle, ensuring that the object continues to follow its circular path. This force is crucial for altering the direction of the object's velocity. Conversely, centrifugal force is the apparent force that seems to push outward, away from the center of the circle. This force arises from the object's inertia, which tends to make it move in a straight line.

Circular motion can be characterized by several key parameters, including angular velocity, angular acceleration, and the period of motion. These parameters are essential for calculating the centripetal force necessary to maintain the object's circular path. A comprehensive understanding of circular motion is vital across various scientific and engineering disciplines, including astronomy, mechanics, and robotics.
