Transverse waves are defined by their oscillation being perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer. This characteristic means that, as the wave propagates forward, the particles within the medium move either up and down or side to side. Examples of transverse waves include electromagnetic waves, such as light, and waves traveling along a string.

One significant property of transverse waves is polarization, which refers to the orientation of the oscillation relative to a reference axis. For instance, light waves can be polarized in vertical or horizontal orientations, or at any angle in between. Polarization plays a crucial role in various applications, including 3D movie technology and polarized sunglasses.

Another important property of transverse waves is amplitude, defined as the maximum displacement of particles from their equilibrium position. The amplitude is directly related to the wave's energy: larger amplitudes correspond to greater energy levels. Additionally, the wavelength of a transverse wave is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs, while frequency represents the number of oscillations that occur per second.

Finally, transverse waves can exhibit behaviors such as reflection, refraction, and interference, similar to other wave types. These phenomena are instrumental in the development of optical devices like mirrors and lenses, as well as in the cancellation of unwanted signals in communication systems.
