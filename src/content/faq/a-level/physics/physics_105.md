The peak voltage of an alternating current (AC) is calculated by multiplying the root-mean-square (RMS) voltage by the square root of 2.

Alternating current (AC) is a type of electrical current that periodically changes direction. The voltage of AC varies over time and is typically expressed in terms of its RMS value. The RMS voltage is the equivalent direct current (DC) voltage that would produce the same amount of power as the AC voltage. For instance, a sinusoidal AC voltage with an RMS value of $10$ volts would generate the same power as a DC voltage of $10$ volts.

The peak voltage of an AC waveform represents the maximum voltage it reaches during a single cycle. It is directly related to the RMS voltage by a factor of the square root of 2. Specifically, the peak voltage ($V_{peak}$) can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
V_{peak} = V_{RMS} \times \sqrt{2}
$$

For example, if the RMS voltage of an AC waveform is $10$ volts, the peak voltage can be calculated as follows:

$$
V_{peak} = 10 \times \sqrt{2} \approx 14.14 \text{ volts}
$$

It is important to distinguish between peak voltage and the amplitude of the AC waveform. The amplitude refers to the maximum deviation of the waveform from its average value and is equal to half of the peak-to-peak voltage. The peak-to-peak voltage is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum voltages of the waveform during one complete cycle. Thus, the amplitude ($A$) of an AC waveform can be calculated as:

$$
A = \frac{V_{peak}}{2}
$$

In summary, understanding the relationships between RMS voltage, peak voltage, peak-to-peak voltage, and amplitude is crucial for accurately analyzing AC waveforms.
