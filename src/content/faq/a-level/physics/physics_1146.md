The weak nuclear force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, crucial for the phenomenon of radioactive decay.

Alongside gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force plays a vital role in the universe. It is responsible for radioactive decay, a process in which an unstable atomic nucleus emits a particle and transitions to a more stable state. This force is mediated by W and Z bosons, which are notably massive and possess very short lifetimes.

In contrast to the other fundamental forces, the weak nuclear force operates over a very short range, approximately $10^{-18}$ meters. Additionally, it is significantly weaker than the other forces, with a strength roughly $10^{-13}$ times that of the electromagnetic force. This relative weakness is why it is termed the "weak force."

The weak nuclear force is essential in various nuclear reactions, such as those that fuel the sun and other stars. It also contributes to the formation of heavy elements during supernova explosions. Furthermore, this force is involved in captivating phenomena in particle physics, including neutrino oscillations and CP violation.

A comprehensive understanding of the weak nuclear force is crucial for grasping the fundamental behavior of matter and the universe at large. Its discovery and subsequent study have yielded significant advancements in physics and technology, including the formulation of the Standard Model of particle physics and the discovery of the Higgs boson.
