Kinetic energy is directly proportional to both mass and velocity.

Kinetic energy refers to the energy that an object possesses as a result of its motion. The formula for calculating kinetic energy is given by 

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$

where $m$ represents the mass of the object and $v$ denotes its velocity. This equation illustrates that kinetic energy is directly proportional to both the mass of the object and the square of its velocity.

To elaborate, if the mass of an object increases, its kinetic energy will also increase at a constant velocity. For instance, consider a truck traveling at $50$ mph: it will have significantly more kinetic energy than a bicycle moving at the same speed, due to the truck's larger mass.

In a similar vein, if the velocity of an object increases, its kinetic energy will also rise, assuming the mass remains constant. For example, a car moving at $100$ mph will possess more kinetic energy than the same car traveling at $50$ mph, since the velocity has been doubled.

It is crucial to understand that the relationship between kinetic energy, mass, and velocity is not linear; instead, it is quadratic. This means that if the velocity of an object is doubled, its kinetic energy will increase by a factor of four. Similarly, if the mass of an object is doubled, its kinetic energy will simply double.

Comprehending the interplay between kinetic energy, mass, and velocity is essential in various branches of physics, including mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. For a deeper exploration of how kinetic energy interacts with other forms of energy, further resources are available. Additionally, the role of kinetic energy in simple harmonic motion offers valuable insights into energy transformations, which are also discussed in detail elsewhere. For a comprehensive overview of the principles of work and energy in physics, additional references can be consulted.

**Summary for A-Level Physics Students**: Kinetic energy, calculated using the formula 

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$

increases with both the object's mass and velocity. The relationship is quadratic: if velocity doubles, kinetic energy quadruples; if mass doubles, kinetic energy also doubles. Understanding this relationship is vital for grasping the dynamics of energy in physics, particularly in areas such as mechanics and thermodynamics.
