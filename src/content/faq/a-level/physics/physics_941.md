The law of conservation of energy asserts that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transformed from one form to another or transferred between systems.

In mechanical systems, this principle indicates that the total energy within a closed system remains constant, unless energy is exchanged with the surroundings. In other words, the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy in a mechanical system is invariant over time.

To illustrate this, consider a simple pendulum. At the highest point of its swing, the pendulum possesses maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. As it descends, the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy, reaching its peak at the lowest point of the swing where kinetic energy is at its maximum and potential energy is zero. As the pendulum ascends again, kinetic energy is converted back into potential energy. Throughout the pendulum's motion, the total energy, defined as the sum of kinetic and potential energy, remains constant.

Another example is a rollercoaster. As the rollercoaster ascends the first hill, it accumulates potential energy. Upon descending, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is subsequently transformed back into potential energy as the rollercoaster climbs the next hill. Once more, the total energy within the system remains unchanged.

In conclusion, the law of conservation of energy is fundamental to mechanical systems, affirming that the total energy within a closed system remains constant unless there is an energy transfer into or out of that system.
