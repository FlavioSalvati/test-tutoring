Baryons are a class of subatomic particles that are composed of three quarks. Notable examples of baryons include protons and neutrons. Quarks, the fundamental constituents of baryons, exist in six distinct "flavors": up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. 

The most prevalent baryons, protons and neutrons, have specific quark compositions. A proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark, which can be represented as: 

$$
\text{Proton} = uu d
$$

In contrast, a neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark:

$$
\text{Neutron} = dd u
$$

Baryons play a crucial role in particle physics as they serve as the fundamental building blocks of atomic nuclei. The strong nuclear force, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the nucleus, operates through the exchange of gluons among the quarks within baryons. Furthermore, baryons are significant in the context of the early universe; they were produced in vast quantities during the Big Bang.

Beyond protons and neutrons, numerous other baryons have been identified, such as hyperons, which contain at least one strange quark, and delta particles, which represent excited states of nucleons. Research into baryons remains a dynamic field in particle physics, continually uncovering new insights and discoveries.
