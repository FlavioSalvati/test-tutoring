A resonant circuit responds to an external driving frequency by either amplifying or attenuating the input signal.

When a resonant circuit is subjected to an external driving frequency, its behavior is influenced by the circuit's resonance frequency, which is defined as the frequency at which the circuit exhibits the highest impedance. If the driving frequency matches the resonance frequency, the circuit will amplify the signal because this is the point of maximum impedance. Conversely, if the driving frequency deviates from the resonance frequency, the circuit will attenuate the signal, as the impedance will be lower.

The extent of amplification or attenuation is characterized by the quality factor, denoted as $Q$. A high-$Q$ circuit features a narrow bandwidth, enabling it to amplify signals more effectively at the resonance frequency. In contrast, a low-$Q$ circuit possesses a wider bandwidth, resulting in greater signal attenuation for frequencies that are further from the resonance frequency.

Resonant circuits are widely utilized in radio and television receivers, where they play a crucial role in selecting a specific frequency from a broad spectrum of signals. Additionally, these circuits are employed in electronic filters to eliminate unwanted frequencies from a signal.
