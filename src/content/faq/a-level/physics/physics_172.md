A transformer is a device that alters the voltage and current of an alternating current (AC) using the principle of electromagnetic induction.

Transformers serve the purpose of transferring electrical energy from one circuit to another through electromagnetic induction. They consist of two coils of wire wound around a shared iron core. The coil connected to the input voltage source is referred to as the primary coil, while the coil linked to the output circuit is called the secondary coil.

When an alternating current flows through the primary coil, it generates a magnetic field around the coil. This changing magnetic field, in turn, induces an alternating current in the secondary coil. The amount of voltage induced in the secondary coil is directly proportional to the number of turns in the coils. Specifically, the voltage in the secondary coil ($V_s$) is related to the voltage in the primary coil ($V_p$) by the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary coil ($N_s$) to the number of turns in the primary coil ($N_p$):

$$
\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \frac{N_s}{N_p}
$$

Consequently, if the number of turns in the secondary coil is greater than that in the primary coil ($N_s > N_p$), the voltage in the secondary coil will exceed that in the primary coil ($V_s > V_p$). Conversely, if the secondary coil has fewer turns than the primary coil ($N_s < N_p$), the voltage in the secondary coil will be lower than that in the primary coil ($V_s < V_p$).

The current in the secondary coil ($I_s$) is also affected by the turns ratio, but in an inversely proportional manner. Specifically, the relationship between the currents and voltages can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{I_s}{I_p} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}
$$

This means that if the voltage in the secondary coil is greater than in the primary coil ($V_s > V_p$), the current in the secondary coil will be less than that in the primary coil ($I_s < I_p$). Conversely, if the voltage in the secondary coil is less than in the primary coil ($V_s < V_p$), then the current in the secondary coil will be greater than that in the primary coil ($I_s > I_p$). 

In summary, transformers efficiently convert voltages between circuits while maintaining the conservation of energy, illustrating the fundamental principles of electromagnetic induction.
