The photoelectric effect refers to the phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a metal surface when light strikes it.

When light with a frequency equal to or greater than a certain threshold is directed at a metal surface, electrons are emitted from that surface. This process is known as the photoelectric effect, and the emitted electrons are referred to as photoelectrons. The energy of these photoelectrons is influenced by both the frequency of the incident light and the work function of the metal. The work function, denoted as $\phi$, represents the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal surface. If the energy of the incident light is lower than the work function, no electrons will be released.

The photoelectric effect can be understood through the principles of quantum theory. According to this theory, light consists of particles called photons. The energy of a photon, $E$, is directly proportional to its frequency, $\nu$, as described by the equation:

$$
E = h\nu
$$

where $h$ is Planck's constant. When a photon collides with a metal surface, it can transfer its energy to an electron within the metal. If the energy of the photon exceeds the work function, the electron can overcome the attractive forces holding it to the metal and escape, thus becoming a photoelectron.

The photoelectric effect has several important practical applications. For example, it is fundamental to the operation of photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight into electricity, and to photoelectric sensors, which detect light and transform it into an electrical signal. Additionally, the photoelectric effect was pivotal in the advancement of quantum mechanics, significantly enhancing our understanding of the nature of matter and energy.
