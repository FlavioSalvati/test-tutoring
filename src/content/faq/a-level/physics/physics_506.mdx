The transition from laminar to turbulent flow is influenced by several key factors.

**Laminar Flow vs. Turbulent Flow**  
Laminar flow is characterized by fluid moving in smooth, parallel layers without any disruption or mixing between them. In contrast, turbulent flow is marked by chaotic and irregular motion of fluid particles. The transition from laminar to turbulent flow is affected by multiple factors, including the Reynolds number, surface roughness, and flow disturbances.

**Reynolds Number**  
The Reynolds number, denoted as $Re$, is a dimensionless quantity that helps determine the flow regime based on the fluid's velocity, density, viscosity, and a characteristic length scale. When the Reynolds number exceeds a certain critical value, the flow becomes unstable, transitioning from laminar to turbulent. The critical Reynolds number varies depending on the geometry of the flow system and the properties of the fluid involved.

**Surface Roughness**  
Surface roughness plays a significant role in inducing the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. When the inner surface of a pipe or channel is rough, it introduces disturbances in the flow, which can disrupt the laminar flow regime and lead to turbulence. The extent of turbulence is influenced by the height and spacing of these surface irregularities.

**Flow Disturbances**  
Disturbances in flow, such as abrupt changes in velocity or pressure, can also facilitate the transition to turbulence. These disturbances generate eddies and vortices within the fluid, which can intensify and eventually cause the flow to become turbulent.

**Conclusion**  
In summary, the transition from laminar to turbulent flow is governed by several factors, including the Reynolds number, surface roughness, and disturbances in the flow. A thorough understanding of these factors is crucial for predicting and controlling fluid behavior in various applications.
