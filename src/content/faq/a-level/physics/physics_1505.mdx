To calculate the root mean square speed of a gas, you can use the formula:

$$
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}}
$$

The root mean square speed, denoted as $v_{\text{rms}}$, represents the average speed of gas particles in a given sample. This calculation incorporates the following variables: $k$, the Boltzmann constant; $T$, the absolute temperature measured in Kelvin; and $m$, the mass of a single gas particle in kilograms.

To apply this formula correctly, you should first convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. This can be achieved by adding $273.15$ to the Celsius temperature. For further details on temperature conversions, please refer to our dedicated section on the topic. Next, determine the mass of one gas particle in kilograms. This can be done by dividing the molar mass of the gas (in grams per mole) by Avogadro's number, which is approximately $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles per mole. You can learn more about Avogadro's number and the concept of moles on our informative page.

Once you have all the necessary values, substitute them into the formula to calculate $v_{\text{rms}}$.

It is crucial to understand that the root mean square speed is an average value. Individual gas particles can exhibit a wide range of speeds around this average. Additionally, the root mean square speed is influenced by both temperature and mass; therefore, any changes to these variables will directly affect the speed of the gas particles. For a deeper insight into how these factors interact under ideal gas conditions, consider reviewing our related material.

### A-Level Physics Tutor Summary:
To determine the average speed of gas particles, use the formula:

$$
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}}
$$

where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, and $m$ is the mass of an individual particle. Remember to convert Celsius to Kelvin and calculate the particle's mass using its molar mass divided by Avogadro's number. This formula yields an average speed that is influenced by both temperature and mass.
