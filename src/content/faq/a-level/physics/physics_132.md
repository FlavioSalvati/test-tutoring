Wave propagation refers to the movement of waves through a medium or vacuum, describing how different types of waves travel in various environments. 

Waves can be categorized into two primary types: mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves. Mechanical waves, such as sound waves, require a medium (like air, water, or solids) to propagate, while electromagnetic waves, such as light waves, can move through a vacuum. For a deeper understanding of these classifications and their unique characteristics, further exploration of the subject is encouraged.

The speed at which a wave propagates is influenced by the properties of the medium it traverses. For instance, sound waves generally travel faster in denser materials, while light waves move more quickly in less dense materials. Additionally, the presence of obstacles can significantly affect wave propagation; phenomena such as reflection, refraction, and diffraction play crucial roles in how waves interact with their environment. Understanding these concepts can provide valuable insights into the behavior of waves in various contexts.

The study of wave propagation is vital across numerous fields, including telecommunications, seismology, and acoustics. By grasping how waves propagate, engineers can design more efficient communication systems, predict earthquake behavior, and enhance the acoustics of concert halls and other venues. Furthermore, an exploration of wave interactions, such as superposition and interference, can deepen our understanding of how waves coexist and influence each other under different conditions.

In summary, wave propagation is the movement of waves through a medium or vacuum. This fundamental concept in physics has significant practical applications in a variety of domains.
