To determine the power delivered by a force, you can simply multiply the force by the velocity of the object.

Power is defined as the rate at which work is performed or energy is transmitted. It is measured in watts (W), and can be calculated using the formula:

$$
P = \frac{W}{t}
$$

where $P$ represents power, $W$ is the work done, and $t$ is the time taken. Work itself is defined as the force applied to an object multiplied by the distance the object moves in the direction of that force, expressed as:

$$
W = F \cdot d
$$

where $F$ is the force and $d$ is the distance. Consequently, power can also be expressed as:

$$
P = F \cdot v
$$

where $v$ is the velocity of the object.

For instance, if a force of $10 \, \text{N}$ is applied to an object moving at a velocity of $5 \, \text{m/s}$, the power delivered by that force can be calculated as follows:

$$
P = F \cdot v = 10 \, \text{N} \cdot 5 \, \text{m/s} = 50 \, \text{W}
$$

This indicates that $50 \, \text{joules}$ of work is being done every second.

It is crucial to ensure that the direction of the force aligns with the direction of the velocity for the calculation to be accurate. If the force and the velocity point in different directions, only the component of the force that acts in the direction of the velocity should be utilized in the calculation.

In summary, to find the power delivered by a force, multiply the force by the object's velocity. This formula is essential for understanding the interplay between force, velocity, and power in various physical scenarios.
