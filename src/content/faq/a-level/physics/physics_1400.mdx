A magnetic field can induce an electric current by altering the magnetic flux through a conductor.

When a conductor is situated within a changing magnetic field, the magnetic flux through that conductor varies. This variation in flux induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the conductor, which subsequently generates an electric current. This phenomenon is referred to as electromagnetic induction and is governed by Faraday's law of induction.

The magnitude of the induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the conductor. In other words, the quicker the magnetic field changes, the greater the induced EMF and the resultant current. The direction of the induced current is determined by Lenz's law, which asserts that the current flows in a direction that opposes the change in magnetic flux that created it.

Electromagnetic induction has numerous practical applications, including in generators, transformers, and motors. In a generator, a rotating coil of wire is placed within a magnetic field, and the changing flux through the coil induces an EMF that generates an electric current. In a transformer, two coils of wire are positioned close to each other, and the changing magnetic field in one coil induces an EMF in the other coil. In a motor, the interplay between a magnetic field and an electric current produces a rotational force.
