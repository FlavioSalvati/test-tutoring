The thin lens formula is a fundamental equation that connects the focal length, object distance, and image distance of a thin lens.

The formula is expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
$$

In this equation, $f$ represents the focal length of the lens, $d_o$ denotes the object distance, and $d_i$ signifies the image distance. This relationship is crucial for determining both the position and size of an image formed by a thin lens.

The underlying principle of the thin lens formula is rooted in the behavior of light rays as they pass through the lens. When light rays encounter a thin lens, they are refracted, or bent, depending on the lens's curvature and the angle at which the rays enter. The focal length of the lens is defined as the distance from the lens to the point where parallel light rays converge after passing through.

Understanding the thin lens formula is vital for analyzing the behavior of lenses in various optical systems, including cameras and telescopes. This formula not only enables the prediction of an image's position and size but also aids in the design of optical systems that achieve specific image characteristics. Mastery of the thin lens formula is essential for anyone studying optics or working in the fields of optics and photonics.
