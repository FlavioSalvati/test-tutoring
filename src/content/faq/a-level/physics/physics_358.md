Dark matter is a theoretical substance that does not interact with light, rendering it invisible to telescopes.

Despite its invisibility, dark matter is believed to constitute approximately $85\%$ of the total matter in the universe. Its existence is inferred from its gravitational influence on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies. Without dark matter, galaxies would lack sufficient mass to remain cohesive and would ultimately disintegrate.

The precise nature of dark matter remains unknown; however, it is hypothesized to be composed of particles that do not engage with electromagnetic radiation. Researchers have proposed several candidates for dark matter particles, including weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions.

The discovery of dark matter has significantly transformed our understanding of the universe, and ongoing research is essential for advancing our knowledge in both cosmology and particle physics. This has prompted the development of new theories and models, such as the Lambda-CDM model, which outlines the evolution of the universe.

In summary, dark matter is an enigmatic substance that plays a crucial role in the universe's structure and dynamics. Its discovery has paved the way for new research opportunities and has prompted a reevaluation of our understanding of the cosmos. As scientists continue to explore the properties of dark matter, we may uncover deeper insights into the fundamental nature of the universe.
