When a wave encounters the boundary between two distinct media, its behavior can be characterized by reflection, transmission, and absorption.

Consider a scenario where a wave transitions from one medium, such as air, to another, like water. Upon reaching the boundary, a portion of the wave's energy is reflected back into the original medium, while another portion is transmitted into the new medium. The specific amounts of reflection and transmission are influenced by the properties of both media, as well as the angle at which the wave strikes the boundary, known as the angle of incidence.

If the wave approaches the boundary at an angle, it experiences refraction, which is the bending of the wave as it enters the new medium. The degree of refraction is determined by both the angle of incidence and the difference in wave speed between the two media.

Conversely, when the wave strikes the boundary perpendicularly, it does not undergo refraction or reflection. Instead, it is absorbed by the new medium. This absorption occurs because the energy from the wave is transferred to the particles within the new medium, causing them to vibrate and dissipate the energy as heat.

In summary, the behavior of a wave at the interface of two different media is contingent upon the characteristics of the media and the angle of incidence. The wave may be reflected, transmitted, refracted, or absorbed, with the proportions of each outcome varying based on the specific circumstances of the interaction.
