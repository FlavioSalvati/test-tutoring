The rate of heat transfer is directly proportional to the surface area of an object.

When an object is heated, heat energy is transferred from the hotter region to the cooler region. This transfer occurs due to the temperature difference between the two regions. Specifically, the rate of heat transfer is directly proportional to both the temperature difference and the surface area of the object. In other words, a larger surface area facilitates a faster rate of heat transfer.

This relationship can be illustrated using the heat transfer equation, which indicates that the rate of heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference between the two regions and the object's surface area. Thus, a larger surface area enables more heat energy to be transferred from the hotter region to the cooler region.

For instance, consider two metal plates at the same temperature: one with a larger surface area and another with a smaller surface area. The plate with the larger surface area will transfer heat energy more rapidly than the smaller plate. This is because the increased surface area allows for a greater amount of heat energy to be transferred from the hotter part of the plate to the cooler part.
