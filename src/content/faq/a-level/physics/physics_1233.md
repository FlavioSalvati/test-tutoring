Torque is a fundamental concept in circular motion, as it is the force that enables an object to rotate around a specific axis.

When an object moves along a circular path, it does so around a fixed point or axis. To change the direction of the object’s motion, a force must be applied. This force is referred to as torque, which serves as the rotational equivalent of linear force. Torque is a vector quantity that quantifies the effect of a force applied to an object, resulting in its rotation about an axis. The magnitude of torque is determined by both the applied force and the distance from the axis of rotation.

The direction of the torque vector is always perpendicular to the plane of rotation and can be determined using the right-hand rule. According to this rule, if you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the object's rotation, your thumb will point in the direction of the torque vector.

In the context of circular motion, torque is crucial as it influences the angular velocity of the object—the rate at which the object’s angle changes over time. A greater applied torque results in a faster rotation of the object.

To summarize, torque is vital in circular motion, enabling an object to rotate around an axis. It is a vector quantity that indicates the force applied to produce this rotational effect. The torque vector is perpendicular to the rotation plane, following the right-hand rule for its direction. Ultimately, torque is instrumental in altering the angular velocity of an object and, consequently, determining its rotational speed.
