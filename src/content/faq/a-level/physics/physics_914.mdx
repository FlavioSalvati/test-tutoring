The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is the remnant glow of the Big Bang, permeating the universe with low-energy electromagnetic radiation.

The CMB represents a form of electromagnetic radiation that fills the entire cosmos. It is the oldest light observable in the universe, originating approximately $380,000$ years after the Big Bang. This radiation is a remnant of the early universe's hot and dense state, during which matter and radiation existed in thermal equilibrium. As the universe expanded and cooled over time, this radiation was stretched to longer wavelengths, transitioning from visible light to microwave radiation.

The CMB serves as a fundamental piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory, offering a glimpse into the universe at an early stage of its development. Its temperature is nearly uniform across the entire sky, with tiny fluctuations on the order of one part in $100,000$. These minute variations are believed to be the initial seeds of the large-scale structure of the universe, influencing the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters.

Extensive studies of the CMB have been conducted by astronomers and cosmologists using advanced telescopes and satellites, including the Planck spacecraft. These observations have yielded precise measurements of both the temperature and polarization of the CMB, significantly enhancing our understanding of the universe's composition, age, and evolution. The CMB is an invaluable resource for exploring the physics of the early universe and for testing various cosmological theories.
