The direction of an electric field is defined by the force exerted on a positive test charge placed within that field.

Electric fields are generated by charged particles, such as electrons and protons. Specifically, the direction of the electric field at any given point is determined by the force that a positive test charge would experience if it were positioned at that point. Consequently, electric fields always point away from positive charges and toward negative charges.

The strength of an electric field is influenced by both the magnitude of the charge producing the field and the distance from the charge. According to the inverse square law, the electric field strength decreases as the distance from the charge increases.

Electric field lines serve as a visual representation of the direction of the electric field at various locations in space. These lines are drawn such that they emanate from positive charges and terminate at negative charges. The density of these lines indicates the strength of the electric field; a greater density of lines corresponds to a stronger electric field.

In summary, the direction of an electric field is dictated by the force acting on a positive test charge. The strength of the electric field is a function of the charge's magnitude and its distance from the point of interest. Electric field lines effectively illustrate both the direction and strength of the electric field.
