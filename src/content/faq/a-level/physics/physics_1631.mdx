A diverging lens corrects myopia by spreading out incoming light rays before they reach the eye.

Myopia, commonly referred to as nearsightedness, is a vision condition in which the eye struggles to focus on distant objects. This issue arises when the eyeball is elongated or the cornea is excessively curved, resulting in light rays converging in front of the retina rather than directly on it. Consequently, distant objects appear blurry to those affected by myopia.

A diverging lens, which is a type of concave lens, causes light rays to spread out or diverge. When positioned in front of a myopic eye, the diverging lens further disperses the incoming light rays. This adjustment decreases the overall convergence of the light rays, effectively shifting the focal point back onto the retina. As a result, the eye can achieve a clear focus on distant objects.

The degree of divergence needed is contingent upon the severity of the myopia. A more myopic eye requires a stronger diverging lens, while a less myopic eye can be corrected with a weaker lens. The power of the lens is quantified in diopters, where a higher negative value signifies a stronger lens.

In summary, a diverging lens effectively corrects myopia by dispersing incoming light rays before they reach the eye. This reduction in convergence moves the focal point back onto the retina, enabling clearer vision of distant objects.
