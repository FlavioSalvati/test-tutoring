An ohmmeter is a device used to measure the resistance of a resistor by passing a small current through it and measuring the resulting voltage drop.

When an ohmmeter is connected to a resistor, it generates a small current, typically around $1 \, \text{mA}$, to prevent any potential damage to the resistor. The device then measures the voltage drop across the resistor. According to Ohm's Law, the voltage drop ($V$) across a resistor is directly proportional to both the current ($I$) flowing through it and its resistance ($R$). This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
V = I \cdot R
$$

By measuring the voltage drop and knowing the current, the ohmmeter can accurately calculate the resistance of the resistor using the formula rearranged as:

$$
R = \frac{V}{I}
$$

The design of an ohmmeter ensures that it can measure resistance accurately, independent of the voltage or current applied to the resistor. This is accomplished through the incorporation of a high-precision internal resistance that is connected in series with the resistor being measured. The internal resistance is finely adjusted to maintain a constant current through the resistor, allowing for an accurate measurement of the voltage drop.

In summary, an ohmmeter measures resistance by sending a small current through a resistor and recording the voltage drop across it. Utilizing Ohm's Law, it calculates the resistance of the resistor based on these measurements. The device is specifically engineered to ensure accurate resistance measurements, regardless of the applied voltage or current, thanks to its high-precision internal resistance.
