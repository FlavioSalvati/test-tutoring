The principle of wave diffraction describes how waves can bend around obstacles and spread out as they propagate.

When a wave encounters an obstacle or passes through a narrow aperture, it has the capacity to bend and radiate outward in various directions. This phenomenon is referred to as diffraction. The degree of diffraction depends on the relationship between the wavelength of the wave and the dimensions of the obstacle or aperture.

If the obstacle is significantly larger than the wavelength of the wave, the wave will primarily reflect off the surface of the obstacle and continue in its original trajectory. In contrast, if the size of the obstacle is comparable to the wavelength, the wave will exhibit noticeable diffraction, bending around the obstacle and dispersing in multiple directions.

Similarly, when a wave travels through a narrow opening, it undergoes diffraction and spreads out upon exiting the other side. This explains why sound waves can be detected around corners and why radio waves can penetrate walls.

Diffraction is a fundamental concept in physics and has numerous practical applications. For instance, it plays a vital role in the design of acoustic barriers that help mitigate noise pollution, as well as in the creation of diffraction gratings utilized in spectroscopy and various optical technologies.
