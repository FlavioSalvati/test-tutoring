A bubble chamber is an essential device used to detect charged particles, such as protons and electrons, as they traverse a superheated liquid. This liquid is typically a mixture of alcohol and water, heated to just below its boiling point. 

When a charged particle enters the chamber, it ionizes the liquid along its path, causing it to boil and creating a trail of bubbles. These bubbles can then be photographed and analyzed for further study.

The superheated liquid in the chamber is maintained at a constant temperature and pressure, allowing it to exist in a metastable state. This means that while the liquid is on the verge of boiling, it has not yet reached its boiling point. As a charged particle moves through the liquid, it generates a trail of bubbles that expand and rise to the surface. Upon reaching the surface, these bubbles burst, releasing gas that was trapped inside. This released gas subsequently condenses into a visible cloud, which can be captured in photographs for analysis.

Bubble chambers were first developed in the 1950s and played a crucial role in particle physics research until the 1980s, when they began to be largely supplanted by more advanced detection technologies, such as silicon strip detectors. Nevertheless, bubble chambers continue to be employed in certain experiments, particularly those involving low-energy particles or rare events that require heightened sensitivity.
