The decay constant is inversely related to the half-life of a radioactive substance.

The decay constant, denoted by $\lambda$, quantifies the rate at which a radioactive substance undergoes decay. It is defined as the probability of decay occurring per unit time and is expressed in units of s$^{-1}$. A higher decay constant indicates a more rapid decay process for the substance.

The half-life, represented as $t_{1/2}$, is the duration required for half of the initial quantity of radioactive nuclei to decay. It is measured in units of time and serves as a characteristic property of a radioactive substance. Importantly, the half-life is independent of the initial amount of the substance present.

The relationship between the decay constant and the half-life can be established through calculus. It can be demonstrated that the decay constant is inversely proportional to the half-life, expressed by the equation:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\ln 2}{t_{1/2}}
$$

This relationship implies that substances with shorter half-lives exhibit higher decay constants, and conversely, those with longer half-lives have lower decay constants.

Understanding the connection between the decay constant and the half-life is crucial in various applications involving radioactive decay, such as radiometric dating and nuclear power generation. This relationship enables us to predict the decay rate of a substance and to calculate the remaining quantity of the substance after a specified time period.
