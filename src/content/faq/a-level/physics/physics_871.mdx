The seven base SI units are: the meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela.

The meter ($m$) is the unit of length, defined as the distance that light travels in a vacuum in a time period of $\frac{1}{299,792,458}$ seconds. The kilogram ($kg$) is the unit of mass, defined as the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram, which is a platinum-iridium cylinder maintained at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. The second ($s$) is the unit of time, defined as the duration of $9,192,631,770$ cycles of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.

The ampere ($A$) is the unit of electric current. It is defined as the constant current that, when maintained in two infinitely long, straight parallel conductors with negligible circular cross-section, produces a force of $2 \times 10^{-7}$ newtons per meter of length between the conductors when they are separated by $1$ meter in a vacuum. The kelvin ($K$) is the unit of temperature, defined as $\frac{1}{273.16}$ of the thermodynamic temperature at the triple point of water.

The mole ($mol$) is the unit of amount of substance, defined as the amount of substance that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in $0.012$ kilograms of carbon-12. Lastly, the candela ($cd$) is the unit of luminous intensity, defined as the intensity, in a specified direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation at a frequency of $540 \times 10^{12}$ hertz, with a radiant intensity in that direction of $\frac{1}{683}$ watts per steradian.
