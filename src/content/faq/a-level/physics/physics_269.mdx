The direction of a magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule, a simple yet effective technique.

To apply the right-hand rule, extend your right thumb in the direction of the current flow. Then, curl your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field. The direction in which your fingers curl indicates the direction of the magnetic field.

This rule is also applicable for determining the force acting on a current-carrying wire placed within a magnetic field. In this case, point your right thumb in the direction of the current, and orient your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field. The direction your palm faces will reveal the direction of the force exerted on the wire.

It's essential to note that the right-hand rule is specifically designed for straight, current-carrying wires. For more complex configurations, such as loops or coils, the right-hand grip rule can be utilized. To use this rule, wrap your right hand around the coil with your fingers aligned in the direction of the current. Your thumb will then point in the direction of the magnetic field inside the coil.

In summary, the right-hand rule serves as a valuable tool for determining both the direction of a magnetic field and the force on a current-carrying wire. Regular practice with this rule will help you become more proficient in applying it to various scenarios.
