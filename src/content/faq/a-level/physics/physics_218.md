Electromagnetic braking operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction, which creates an opposing magnetic field to facilitate deceleration.

When an electric current flows through a conductor, it generates a magnetic field around it. Conversely, when a conductor moves through an existing magnetic field, an electric current is induced within that conductor. This fundamental principle of electromagnetic induction was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831.

In the context of electromagnetic braking, the braking system utilizes a magnetic field to slow down or halt a moving object. When the brakes are engaged, an electric current is introduced into a coil of wire within the brake assembly, producing a magnetic field. This generated magnetic field interacts with the metal disc or rotor connected to the wheel, creating a force that opposes the wheel's motion. This opposing force effectively slows the wheel, bringing the vehicle to a stop.

Electromagnetic braking is widely employed in trains, where it is often referred to as regenerative braking. In this system, the kinetic energy of the moving train is converted into electrical energy, which can be stored in a battery or utilized to power other onboard systems. This process minimizes energy loss as heat, enhancing the overall efficiency of the train and contributing to its environmental sustainability.
