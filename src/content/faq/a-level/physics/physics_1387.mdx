To determine the maximum speed in simple harmonic motion, we can utilize the formula:

$$
v_{\text{max}} = A \omega
$$

In simple harmonic motion, an object oscillates back and forth around a central equilibrium position. The displacement of the object from this equilibrium point is described by the equation:

$$
x = A \sin(\omega t)
$$

Here, $A$ represents the amplitude of the motion, while $\omega$ denotes the angular frequency.

To find the velocity of the object, we take the derivative of the displacement with respect to time:

$$
v = \frac{dx}{dt} = A \omega \cos(\omega t)
$$

The maximum velocity occurs when $\cos(\omega t) = 1$, which is the case when $\omega t = 0$ or $2\pi$. Thus, the maximum velocity can be expressed as:

$$
v_{\text{max}} = A \omega
$$

It is crucial to understand that the maximum velocity occurs at the equilibrium point, where the displacement is zero. At this position, all of the system's potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy, resulting in the highest speed. As the object moves away from the equilibrium point, its speed decreases, eventually reaching zero at the maximum displacement.

In conclusion, the maximum speed in simple harmonic motion can be calculated using the formula:

$$
v_{\text{max}} = A \omega
$$

In this equation, $A$ is the amplitude of the motion, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. This maximum speed is observed at the equilibrium point, where all potential energy has transformed into kinetic energy.
