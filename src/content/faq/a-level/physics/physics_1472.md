A Geiger-Müller tube is a device designed to detect ionizing radiation by measuring the ionization caused by that radiation.

This type of detector consists of a cylindrical metal tube filled with a low-pressure gas, such as helium, neon, or argon. Inside the tube, there is a central wire electrode surrounded by a cylindrical metal outer electrode. When ionizing radiation enters the tube, it ionizes the gas atoms, resulting in the production of a cascade of electrons and positive ions. The negatively charged electrons are attracted to the central wire electrode, while the positively charged ions move toward the outer electrode.

The ionization process generates a current pulse, which is amplified and counted by an electronic circuit. This circuit produces an audible click or a visual indication of the detection. The frequency of these clicks or counts per unit time is directly proportional to the intensity of the radiation detected. The Geiger-Müller tube is highly sensitive, capable of detecting alpha, beta, and gamma radiation.

There are several advantages to using a Geiger-Müller tube compared to other types of radiation detectors. It is user-friendly, relatively low-cost, and can be manufactured in a compact form. Additionally, it is sensitive enough to detect low levels of radiation from a wide variety of sources. However, it does have some limitations, including its inability to measure the energy of the radiation and its tendency to saturate when exposed to high radiation levels.
