Energy is conserved in simple harmonic motion due to the dynamic interaction between kinetic and potential energy.

In simple harmonic motion, the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position, leading to oscillations around a central point. As the object moves away from equilibrium, it accumulates potential energy, which is then converted into kinetic energy as the object returns toward equilibrium. At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is minimized, while the kinetic energy reaches its maximum.

As the object continues to oscillate, the potential and kinetic energies continuously interchange, yet the total mechanical energy remains constant. This phenomenon exemplifies the principle of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another.

For instance, consider a simple pendulum. The potential energy is maximized when the pendulum is at its highest point, whereas the kinetic energy is maximized when the pendulum is at its lowest point. Throughout its motion, the total energy of the pendulum remains constant, provided that no external forces are acting on it.

In summary, the conservation of energy in simple harmonic motion is a fundamental principle that enables us to understand and analyze a wide array of physical phenomena, ranging from oscillating springs to musical instruments.
