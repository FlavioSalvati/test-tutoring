Wave propagation describes the manner in which waves travel through a medium or space.

When a wave is generated, it moves through a medium or space, transferring energy from one location to another. The medium can take the form of a solid, liquid, or gas, while the wave itself may be a sound wave, light wave, or electromagnetic wave. The speed at which the wave propagates is influenced by the properties of the medium, including its density and elasticity.

In a solid medium, such as a metal rod, waves propagate by compressing and expanding the material. In liquids or gases, like water or air, waves cause the particles to oscillate back and forth. In contrast, electromagnetic waves can traverse the vacuum of space without requiring a medium.

The propagation of waves can be influenced by several factors, including interference, diffraction, and reflection. Interference occurs when two waves overlap, either reinforcing each other or canceling each other out. Diffraction refers to the bending of a wave around obstacles, while reflection describes the bouncing back of a wave upon encountering a boundary.

A comprehensive understanding of wave propagation is crucial in various branches of physics, such as acoustics, optics, and electromagnetism. Additionally, this knowledge is vital in fields like telecommunications, where the propagation of electromagnetic waves is essential for transmitting information over long distances.
