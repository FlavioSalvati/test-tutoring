Newton's laws of motion provide a fundamental framework for understanding orbital motion, particularly how objects behave within a gravitational field.

In the context of orbital motion, an object is perpetually in free fall towards the center of the gravitational field. However, its forward velocity prevents it from colliding with the central body. This phenomenon is governed by Newton's first law of motion, which asserts that an object will maintain its state of uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force.

Newton's second law of motion states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration, expressed mathematically as $F = ma$. This law elucidates how the gravitational force acting on an object in orbit causes it to accelerate towards the central body. The acceleration experienced by the object is directly proportional to the gravitational force and inversely proportional to the object's mass.

Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This principle explains that the central body is also influenced by the orbiting object. Specifically, the central body is attracted towards the orbiting object with an equal force to that which the orbiting object experiences as it is pulled towards the central body.

In summary, Newton's laws of motion collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of how objects interact within a gravitational field, elucidating the mechanics behind their stable orbits around a central body.
