A wave train refers to a series of waves that share the same frequency and wavelength, traveling through a medium or space.

Wave trains consist of a sequence of waves that propagate over time. The distance between two consecutive crests or troughs is known as the wavelength, denoted as $\lambda$. Conversely, the frequency, represented as $f$, is defined as the number of waves that pass a specific point per unit of time. The relationship between these two properties determines the speed of the wave, which can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
v = f \cdot \lambda
$$

where $v$ is the wave speed.

Wave trains can originate from various sources, including vibrating strings, sound waves, and electromagnetic waves. In each instance, the wave train comprises a series of waves generated at regular intervals, propagating through the medium or space. While the amplitude of the waves in the train may fluctuate over time, their frequency and wavelength remain constant.

Mathematical techniques such as Fourier analysis can be employed to analyze wave trains. This method allows a wave to be decomposed into its constituent frequencies, providing valuable insights into the wave train's properties and behavior over time. Wave trains are fundamental in the field of physics, as they help describe a vast array of phenomena, including the behavior of light and sound waves, as well as the motion of particles in quantum mechanics.
