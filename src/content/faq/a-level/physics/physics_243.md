Planetary nebulae are formed from the ejected outer layers of dying stars with low to intermediate mass.

As a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it undergoes a series of transformations that ultimately lead to its demise. For stars of low to intermediate mass, this final stage culminates in the creation of a planetary nebula. When a star depletes its fuel supply, it expands into a red giant and begins to shed its outer layers. These layers are expelled into space, resulting in a shell surrounding the central core of the star.

The ejected material becomes ionized due to the intense ultraviolet radiation emitted by the hot core, causing it to emit a bright glow and form a planetary nebula. The shape of the nebula is influenced by the interaction between the expelled material and the hot core. Eventually, the core cools and transforms into a white dwarf, while the planetary nebula continues to expand and disperse throughout space.

Planetary nebulae are significant objects for studying the later stages of stellar evolution. They provide valuable insights into the chemical composition of the universe and the processes that govern star formation and evolution. By studying planetary nebulae, we can also gain a better understanding of the fate of our own Sun, which is destined to undergo a similar process and form a planetary nebula billions of years in the future.
