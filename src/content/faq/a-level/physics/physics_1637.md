A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy by accumulating charge on its plates, which in turn generates an electric field.

When a voltage is applied across a capacitor, electrons are pushed onto one plate, resulting in that plate becoming negatively charged, while the opposite plate acquires a positive charge. This separation of charges establishes an electric field between the plates, thereby enabling the capacitor to store energy. The energy ($E$) stored in a capacitor is directly proportional to both the voltage ($V$) applied across it and its capacitance ($C$), expressed mathematically as:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2.
$$

Capacitance is a measure of a capacitor's ability to store electric charge and is influenced by factors such as the area of the plates, the distance between them, and the type of dielectric material located between the plates. A higher capacitance value indicates that a capacitor can store more charge for a given voltage.

When a capacitor is integrated into a circuit, it can discharge its stored energy rapidly, resulting in a surge of current. This characteristic makes capacitors valuable in various applications, including power supplies, filters, and timing circuits.

In summary, capacitors store energy by creating an electric field between two plates, with the amount of stored energy being proportional to the applied voltage and the capacitor's capacitance. They can release this energy quickly as a burst of current when connected to an electrical circuit.
