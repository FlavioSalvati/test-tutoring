A converging lens, commonly referred to as a convex lens, is characterized by being thicker in the center and thinner at the edges. This type of lens causes parallel rays of light to converge at a specific point known as the focal point. Converging lenses are widely utilized in optical devices such as cameras, telescopes, and microscopes to enlarge images. The distance from the lens to the focal point is termed the focal length, which serves as an indicator of the lens's optical power; a shorter focal length corresponds to a stronger lens. To gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of light through these lenses, one can explore the principles of optics.

On the other hand, a diverging lens, also known as a concave lens, is thinner in the center and thicker at the edges. This lens causes parallel rays of light to spread apart, making objects appear smaller and farther away than they truly are. Diverging lenses are commonly found in eyeglasses designed to correct nearsightedness. The focal point associated with a diverging lens is virtual, which means it appears to be located behind the lens. The distance from the lens to this virtual focal point is likewise referred to as the focal length. For a more comprehensive understanding of the refraction of light through these lenses, one can investigate relevant optical concepts.

In summary, a converging (convex) lens is thicker in the center, causing light rays to converge at a focal point. This property makes it valuable for magnifying objects in devices such as cameras and microscopes. Conversely, a diverging (concave) lens is thinner in the center, causing light rays to diverge, which results in objects appearing smaller; this characteristic is often utilized in eyeglasses for nearsightedness correction. Each type of lens has a focal length that indicates its optical strength. Additionally, exploring the fundamental principles of optics can further enhance your understanding of how light interacts with these lenses.
