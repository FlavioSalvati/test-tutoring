Kinetic energy refers to the energy an object possesses due to its motion, while potential energy is the energy stored within an object based on its position or configuration.

Kinetic energy is determined by both the mass and velocity of the object. The mathematical expression for kinetic energy is given by:

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$

In this formula, $m$ represents the mass of the object and $v$ denotes its velocity. It's important to note that kinetic energy is a scalar quantity, which means it has magnitude but no directional component.

On the other hand, potential energy is the energy an object holds due to its position or configuration, reflecting its capacity to perform work. There are various forms of potential energy, including gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy, and electric potential energy. 

Gravitational potential energy is the energy an object possesses as a result of its location within a gravitational field. The formula for gravitational potential energy can be expressed as:

$$
PE = mgh
$$

In this equation, $m$ is the mass of the object, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height of the object above a designated reference point. 

Elastic potential energy, on the other hand, is the energy stored in a spring when it is either stretched or compressed. Electric potential energy arises from the position of charged particles within an electric field.

It is also worth noting that potential energy, like kinetic energy, is a scalar quantity.

In conclusion, kinetic energy represents the energy of motion, whereas potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration. Both forms of energy play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of physical systems.
