A quasar is an incredibly energetic and distant celestial object that emits vast amounts of radiation.

Quasars, which is short for "quasi-stellar radio sources," rank among the most luminous and energetic entities in the universe. They are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes located at the centers of galaxies. These black holes accrete matter, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the form of radiation and high-speed particle jets. Quasars were first identified in the 1960s as enigmatic radio sources that appeared star-like when observed through optical telescopes, yet they were found to emit intense radio waves and X-rays.

These fascinating objects are situated billions of light-years away from Earth. Their emitted light serves as a valuable probe into the early universe, carrying crucial information about the conditions and evolution of the cosmos at the time of emission. Additionally, quasars play a significant role in testing theories of gravity and cosmology, as they can provide insights into the large-scale distribution of matter and the geometry of space-time.

Despite their remarkable brightness, the extreme distances of quasars make them challenging to observe and study in detail. Consequently, many questions concerning their properties and origins remain unanswered.
