Ultrasound technology measures blood flow by employing the Doppler effect to detect variations in the frequency of reflected sound waves.

Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging technique that utilizes high-frequency sound waves to create images of internal body structures. In addition to imaging, it is also effective in measuring blood flow within the body. The Doppler effect plays a crucial role in this process by identifying changes in the frequency of sound waves that are reflected off moving objects, such as red blood cells.

When sound waves are reflected off a stationary object, the frequency of these reflected waves remains unchanged and is identical to that of the original waves. However, when the object is in motion, the frequency of the reflected waves will vary. Specifically, if the object moves toward the source of the sound waves, the frequency of the reflected waves increases. Conversely, if the object moves away from the source, the frequency decreases.

In the context of blood flow, ultrasound technology transmits sound waves into the body, and the reflected waves are analyzed to ascertain both the direction and speed of the blood flow. The frequency shift of these reflected waves is then used to calculate the velocity of the blood. This valuable information aids in diagnosing various medical conditions such as blood clots, arterial stenosis, and venous insufficiency.

In summary, ultrasound leverages the Doppler effect to evaluate blood flow by detecting alterations in the frequency of reflected sound waves. This non-invasive technique is extensively utilized in medical imaging for diagnosing and monitoring a wide range of health conditions.
