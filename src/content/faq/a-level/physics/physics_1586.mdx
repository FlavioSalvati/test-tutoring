The law of radioactive decay describes how the rate at which a radioactive substance decays is directly proportional to the quantity of that substance present.

Radioactive decay refers to the process whereby an unstable atomic nucleus emits particles or electromagnetic radiation, leading to the transformation of the nucleus into a more stable configuration. The rate of this decay is quantified by the half-life, which is defined as the time required for half of the original sample to undergo decay. According to the law of radioactive decay, the rate of decay is proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei available. This implies that a greater number of radioactive nuclei results in a faster decay rate.

Mathematically, the law of radioactive decay can be represented by the equation:

$$
N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}
$$

In this equation, $N(t)$ denotes the number of radioactive nuclei at time $t$, $N_0$ represents the initial quantity of radioactive nuclei, $\lambda$ is the decay constant specific to the substance, and $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to $2.718$. This equation illustrates that the quantity of radioactive nuclei decreases exponentially over time, with a decay constant that is unique to each radioactive element.

The law of radioactive decay has numerous practical applications. One notable application is radiometric dating, a method used to determine the age of rocks and fossils. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in medical imaging, where radioactive isotopes are utilized to track the movement of substances within the human body. Consequently, a thorough understanding of the law of radioactive decay is vital across various scientific and technological disciplines.
