The Standard Model of particle physics comprises six families of fundamental particles: quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, the Higgs boson, and neutrinos.

Quarks serve as the fundamental constituents of protons and neutrons and exist in six distinct types, commonly referred to as "flavours". Leptons include particles such as electrons, muons, and tau particles; notably, leptons are not influenced by the strong nuclear force. Gauge bosons are the particles responsible for mediating the fundamental forces of nature. For instance, photons mediate the electromagnetic force, while the W and Z bosons mediate the weak nuclear force. The Higgs boson plays a crucial role in providing mass to other particles. Neutrinos are neutral particles that interact only weakly with matter and come in three different types or "flavours".

Each family of particles has an associated antiparticle that possesses the same mass but has an opposite charge. Additionally, both quarks and leptons exhibit a property known as "spin". This intrinsic angular momentum not only imparts a magnetic moment to these particles but also influences their interactions with one another.

The Standard Model also introduces the concept of "colour charge", which pertains to the strong nuclear force that binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons. Quarks can have one of three "colours"—red, green, or blue—and they can combine in such a way that the resulting particles are colour-neutral.

In summary, the Standard Model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the fundamental particles and forces that constitute our universe. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the Standard Model is not an all-encompassing theory, as it does not account for phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy.
