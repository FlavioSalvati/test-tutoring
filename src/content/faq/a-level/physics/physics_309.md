To calculate the efficiency of a machine, you can determine it by dividing the useful output by the total input.

Efficiency is a crucial measure that indicates how effectively a machine converts input energy into useful output energy. It is typically expressed as a percentage and is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{\text{Useful Output}}{\text{Total Input}} \right) \times 100
$$

In this context, the **useful output** refers to the energy that is actually employed to accomplish the desired task, while the **total input** signifies the total energy supplied to the machine.

For instance, consider a machine that requires $1000 \, \text{J}$ of energy to perform a task, but only $800 \, \text{J}$ of that energy is effectively used. The efficiency of this machine can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \left( \frac{800 \, \text{J}}{1000 \, \text{J}} \right) \times 100 = 80\%
$$

This indicates that $20\%$ of the energy supplied to the machine is wasted.

It is crucial to understand that no machine can achieve $100\%$ efficiency, as some energy is invariably lost due to factors such as friction, heat, and other inefficiencies. Nonetheless, engineers aim to design machines that operate with the highest possible efficiency to minimize waste and enhance performance.

To improve a machine's efficiency, strategies may include reducing friction, enhancing lubrication, or integrating more efficient components. By meticulously analyzing the design and operational aspects of a machine, engineers can pinpoint areas for improvement and work towards increasing its overall efficiency.
