Real power is the actual power consumed by a circuit, while reactive power refers to the power that is stored and then released by the components within the circuit.

Real power, often referred to as active power, is the power utilized by a circuit to perform useful work, such as illuminating a light bulb or operating a motor. It is measured in watts and is denoted by the symbol $P$. Real power can be calculated as the product of voltage and current in a circuit, and it is always a positive value.

In contrast, reactive power is the power that is temporarily stored and released by circuit components such as capacitors and inductors. This type of power is measured in volt-amperes reactive (VAR) and is represented by the symbol $Q$. Although reactive power does not contribute to any useful work, it plays a crucial role in the functioning of certain electrical devices, including motors and transformers.

The total power in an alternating current (AC) circuit is the sum of real power and reactive power, and it is measured in volt-amperes (VA). The ratio of real power to total power is known as the power factor, which is a vital parameter in the design and operation of AC circuits. A low power factor indicates inefficiency, suggesting that the circuit is consuming more power than necessary, while a high power factor signifies efficient operation, indicating that the circuit is utilizing power effectively.
