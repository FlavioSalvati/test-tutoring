A wire chamber is a specialized device used in experimental physics to detect charged particles by measuring the ionization produced as they pass through it.

This type of particle detector consists of a grid of thin metal wires arranged in a precise pattern, with a high voltage applied across them. When a charged particle traverses the chamber, it ionizes the gas molecules along its path, generating a trail of positively charged ions. These ions are attracted to the negatively charged wires, which initiates a cascade of additional ionization events. This process results in a detectable signal that can be recorded for analysis.

Wire chambers are capable of detecting a broad spectrum of charged particles, ranging from electrons to heavy ions. They are particularly effective for detecting low-energy particles due to their high sensitivity to small ionization signals. Additionally, wire chambers can track the trajectory of a particle within the chamber, enabling scientists to reconstruct its path and analyze its properties.

These detectors are extensively utilized in particle physics experiments, including those conducted at CERN and other major research facilities. Furthermore, wire chambers find applications in medical imaging, where they help trace the paths of charged particles emitted by radioactive isotopes within the human body.
