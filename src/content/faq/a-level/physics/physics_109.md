The charge of a particle in a cloud chamber can be determined by analyzing its curvature in a magnetic field.

A cloud chamber is an experimental device that enables us to visualize the trajectories of charged particles as they traverse through it. When a charged particle enters the chamber, it ionizes the surrounding gas molecules along its path, resulting in a trail of ions. These ions serve as nucleation sites for water droplets to condense around, thereby creating a visible track that can be captured in photographs.

To ascertain the charge of a particle, the chamber is placed within a magnetic field. This magnetic field induces a curvature in the path of the charged particle as it moves through the gas. The direction and degree of curvature of the particle's trajectory depend on several factors, including its charge, mass, and velocity.

By measuring the radius of curvature of the particle's path, we can calculate its charge-to-mass ratio. This relationship arises because the radius of curvature is proportional to the particle's momentum, which is also proportional to its charge-to-mass ratio.

If the mass of the particle is known, we can subsequently determine its charge. For instance, if we observe a particle with a radius of curvature that indicates a charge-to-mass ratio of $1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C/kg}$ (which is equivalent to the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron), we can confidently conclude that the particle in question is an electron.

In summary, the charge of a particle in a cloud chamber is determined by examining its curvature in a magnetic field and using the charge-to-mass ratio to deduce its charge.
