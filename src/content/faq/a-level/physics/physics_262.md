To calculate the number of moles of a gas using the ideal gas law, you can utilize the formula:

$$ n = \frac{PV}{RT} $$

The ideal gas law is a mathematical relationship that describes the behavior of gases under specific conditions. It connects the pressure ($P$), volume ($V$), temperature ($T$), and the number of moles ($n$) of a gas. The complete equation is expressed as:

$$ PV = nRT $$

In this equation, $R$ represents the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature measured in Kelvin.

To determine the number of moles of gas, simply rearrange the ideal gas law to isolate $n$:

$$ n = \frac{PV}{RT} $$

This formula can be applied when the values for pressure, volume, temperature, and the gas constant are known. By substituting these known values into the formula, you can easily solve for $n$, which will yield the number of moles of the gas.

It is essential to understand that the ideal gas law is only valid for ideal gasesâ€”hypothetical gases that adhere to specific assumptions about their behavior. Real gases may deviate from this ideal behavior, particularly under conditions of high pressure and low temperature. In such scenarios, alternative equations of state should be considered to accurately describe the behavior of real gases.
