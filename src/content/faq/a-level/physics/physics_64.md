To determine the work performed by a force, you multiply the force by the distance over which it acts.

Work is defined as the energy transferred when a force influences an object, causing it to move. The mathematical expression for work is given by the formula:

$$
W = F \times d
$$

where:
- $W$ represents the work done,
- $F$ denotes the magnitude of the applied force, and
- $d$ indicates the distance moved in the direction of the force.

The standard unit of work is the joule (J).

It's crucial to understand that work is only accomplished when the force and the displacement are aligned in the same direction. If the force is applied perpendicular to the direction of displacement, then no work is done. Conversely, if the force acts in the opposite direction to the displacement, the work done is considered negative, signifying a transfer of energy away from the object.

In scenarios where the force varies along the distance moved, the work can be computed by dividing the distance into small intervals. For each interval, you multiply the force at that point by the distance moved within that interval. The total work done is then the aggregate of the work calculated for each individual interval.

In conclusion, to compute the work done by a force, multiply the force by the distance moved in the direction of the force. The relationship can be summarized by the formula:

$$
W = F \times d
$$

with work measured in joules (J).
