The principle of superposition in wave mechanics asserts that when two or more waves converge, the total displacement of the medium is the cumulative sum of the individual displacements produced by each wave.

When these waves intersect, they interact through a process known as interference. According to the principle of superposition, the net displacement at any given point in space and time is the sum of all individual wave displacements. This phenomenon allows for two types of interference: constructive interference, where the waves combine to amplify the overall amplitude, and destructive interference, where they may partially or completely cancel each other out, leading to a reduction in amplitude.

This principle is universally applicable to all types of waves, including sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and water waves. It serves as a foundational concept in wave mechanics, helping to elucidate various phenomena such as interference patterns, diffraction, and standing waves.

In addition to the principle of superposition, wave mechanics encompasses other essential concepts, including wave speed, wavelength, frequency, and amplitude. By grasping these concepts and applying the principle of superposition, physicists can effectively predict and interpret the behavior of waves across different scenarios.
