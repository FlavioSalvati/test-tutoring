To analyze a DC circuit using nodal analysis, follow these systematic steps:

1. **Identify Nodes**: Begin by identifying all the nodes in the circuit. A node is defined as a point where three or more circuit elements intersect. Choose a reference node, typically the one with the highest number of connections, and label all other nodes accordingly.

2. **Apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)**: Write down the KCL equations for each of the identified nodes. According to KCL, the total current flowing into a node must equal the total current flowing out of that node. Utilize Ohm's Law to express the currents in terms of the node voltages.

3. **Solve for Node Voltages**: Once you have formed the KCL equations, solve the resulting system of equations to determine the node voltages. This can be accomplished using matrix algebra techniques or manually if the circuit is relatively simple.

4. **Calculate Additional Circuit Quantities**: After obtaining the node voltages, use them to compute any other quantities of interest in the circuit. This includes determining the currents flowing through resistors or the power dissipated in various components.

Nodal analysis is a powerful technique for examining complex DC circuits, enabling you to effectively manage circuits with numerous nodes and non-linear components. However, it may require significant algebraic manipulation and can become time-consuming for larger circuits.
