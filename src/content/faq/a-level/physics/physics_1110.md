A nova is an astronomical phenomenon that occurs when a white dwarf star accumulates material from a companion star, leading to a thermonuclear explosion on its surface.

Novae are transient events typically found in binary star systems. They are primarily triggered when a white dwarf, often paired with a red giant, begins to accrete material from its companion. As the white dwarf gains mass, both its temperature and pressure rise. Once these parameters reach a critical threshold, a thermonuclear explosion ignites on the surface of the white dwarf.

This explosive event releases an immense amount of energy, resulting in a dramatic increase in the brightness of the white dwarf. Additionally, the explosion expels material into space at high velocities, forming a shell of gas around the white dwarf. This shell can be observed as a nebula surrounding the nova.

It is important to differentiate novae from supernovae. Unlike supernovae, which result in the complete destruction of the star, novae leave the white dwarf intact. Consequently, the white dwarf can continue to accrete material from its companion, potentially leading to subsequent nova events.

Studying novae is crucial for understanding the evolution of binary star systems and the role of white dwarf stars in the cosmos. Furthermore, novae serve as valuable distance indicators, enabling astronomers to measure distances to other galaxies more accurately.
