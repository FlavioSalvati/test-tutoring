Centrifugal force is the apparent force that seems to pull an object away from the center of rotation. 

It is important to note that centrifugal force is a fictitious force; it does not exist in the same way that other forces do. Instead, it arises from the inertia of an object traveling along a circular path. The magnitude of this perceived force is influenced by two primary factors: the speed of the object and the radius of the circular path. Specifically, the faster an object moves or the smaller the radius of the circle, the greater the centrifugal force that appears to act on it.

In contrast, centripetal force is a genuine force that is responsible for maintaining an object’s circular motion. This force acts inward, towards the center of rotation, and is essential for changing the direction of the object’s velocity. The magnitude of the centripetal force can be calculated using the formula:

$$ F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r} $$

where:
- $F_c$ is the centripetal force,
- $m$ is the mass of the object,
- $v$ is the velocity of the object,
- $r$ is the radius of the circular path.

In summary, centrifugal force is an apparent force that seems to push objects away from the center of rotation, whereas centripetal force is the actual force that ensures an object continues to move in a circular trajectory by acting toward the center of rotation.
