To calculate the partial pressure of gases using Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, you need to sum the pressures of each gas present in the mixture.

Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures states that the total pressure of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases within that mixture. This law operates under the assumption that the gases do not interact with one another and behave independently.

To find the partial pressure of a specific gas in a mixture, you first need to determine the mole fraction of that gas. The mole fraction is defined as the ratio of the number of moles of the gas to the total number of moles in the mixture. Once you have the mole fraction, you can calculate the partial pressure by multiplying the mole fraction by the total pressure of the mixture.

For example, consider a gas mixture containing $0.2$ moles of oxygen and $0.8$ moles of nitrogen, with a total pressure of $1$ atm. The mole fraction of oxygen can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Mole fraction of oxygen} = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.8} = 0.2
$$

Using this mole fraction, the partial pressure of oxygen can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Partial pressure of oxygen} = 0.2 \times 1 \text{ atm} = 0.2 \text{ atm}
$$

Similarly, you can calculate the partial pressure of nitrogen:

$$
\text{Partial pressure of nitrogen} = 0.8 \times 1 \text{ atm} = 0.8 \text{ atm}
$$

It is crucial to note that Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures is primarily applicable to ideal gases, which are defined as having no volume and no intermolecular forces. Real gases may deviate from ideal behavior, particularly at high pressures and low temperatures, necessitating corrections to account for these deviations.
