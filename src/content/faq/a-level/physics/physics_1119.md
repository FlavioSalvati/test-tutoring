CT scans, or computed tomography scans, utilize X-rays to generate intricate three-dimensional images of the body's internal structures. During the procedure, the patient lies on a table that moves into a doughnut-shaped device known as a CT scanner. As the scanner rotates around the patient, it captures numerous two-dimensional X-ray images from various angles. These images are then processed by a computer to construct a comprehensive 3D representation of the targeted body part. 

X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation capable of penetrating the body, with their absorption varying according to the type of tissue. For instance, denser tissues, like bones, absorb a greater amount of X-rays, while softer tissues, such as organs, absorb fewer. This differential absorption is fundamental to the CT scanner's ability to produce detailed internal images.

To create the 3D image from the collection of 2D X-ray images, the computer employs a method known as back projection. This technique integrates the information from each X-ray image to reconstruct a detailed three-dimensional view of the scanned area. The resulting images can be examined from multiple perspectives and reveal intricate structures, including blood vessels, organs, and bones.

In summary, CT scans leverage X-rays to produce three-dimensional images by capturing multiple two-dimensional X-ray images from different angles and processing them with computer technology. This advanced technique facilitates the creation of detailed internal images, which are invaluable for diagnosis and treatment planning.
