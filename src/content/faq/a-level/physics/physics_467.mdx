Kinetic energy transforms into potential energy in a projectile due to the influence of gravity.

When a projectile is launched, it possesses kinetic energy as a result of its motion. As it ascends, gravity exerts a downward force, causing the projectile to decelerate and gradually lose kinetic energy. This lost kinetic energy is converted into potential energy as the projectile rises to greater heights.

The potential energy of the projectile arises from its position within the Earth's gravitational field. The higher the projectile ascends, the greater its potential energy becomes. This potential energy can be calculated using the formula:

$$
PE = mgh
$$

where $m$ represents the mass of the projectile, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ denotes the height of the projectile above the ground.

At the peak of its trajectory, the projectile reaches its highest point, where it has zero kinetic energy and all of its energy is stored as potential energy. As the projectile begins to descend, this potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy, resulting in an increase in speed as it falls. This process continues until the projectile impacts the ground.

In summary, the transformation of kinetic energy into potential energy in a projectile is driven by the force of gravity. As the projectile ascends, it loses kinetic energy and gains potential energy. Conversely, upon descent, this potential energy is transformed back into kinetic energy.
