Nuclear fusion is the process of combining two atomic nuclei to create a heavier nucleus.

This phenomenon is the fundamental source of energy for the sun and other stars. During nuclear fusion, two atomic nuclei merge to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a substantial amount of energy in the process. This energy is produced through the conversion of mass into energy, as expressed by Einstein's renowned equation, $E=mc^2$.

The most prevalent fusion reaction in stars involves the fusion of hydrogen nuclei, or protons, to form helium. This reaction takes place in the sun's core, where the temperature and pressure are sufficiently high to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei. The fusion of hydrogen nuclei generates a significant amount of energy, released in the form of light and heat, which is what causes the sun to shine.

Nuclear fusion holds the promise of providing a virtually limitless source of clean energy on Earth. However, achieving controlled fusion reactions on our planet presents considerable scientific and engineering challenges. Current fusion experiments focus on heating hydrogen isotopes to extremely high temperatures and confining them with powerful magnetic fields. If these efforts prove successful, fusion could become a safe, sustainable, and carbon-free energy source for future generations.
