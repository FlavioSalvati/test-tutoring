Astigmatism is a prevalent optical condition in which the eye struggles to focus light evenly on the retina.

This condition is classified as a type of refractive error, influencing how the eye directs light. In a healthy eye, both the cornea and the lens have a smooth, uniform curvature, enabling light to focus accurately on the retina. Conversely, in an eye affected by astigmatism, either the cornea or the lens is irregularly shaped. This irregularity results in light being focused unevenly on the retina, leading to blurred or distorted vision, especially at certain distances or angles.

Astigmatism can be diagnosed through a comprehensive eye examination. This assessment typically includes several tests: a visual acuity test to measure how well you can see, a refraction test to determine the appropriate prescription for corrective lenses, and a keratometry test to assess the curvature of the cornea. 

Treatment for astigmatism generally involves corrective lenses, such as glasses or contact lenses, which help counterbalance the uneven curvature of the cornea or lens. In some instances, refractive surgery may be considered as an option to reshape the cornea and enhance vision.

Although astigmatism is a common condition, it can lead to significant visual impairment if left untreated. Therefore, regular eye examinations are essential for the early detection and management of astigmatism and other vision issues.
