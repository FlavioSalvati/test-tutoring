To determine the average power delivered by an alternating current (AC), you can use the formula:

$$
P = V_{\text{rms}} I_{\text{rms}} \cos(\theta)
$$

In this equation, $P$ represents the average power, $V_{\text{rms}}$ is the root mean square (RMS) voltage, $I_{\text{rms}}$ is the RMS current, and $\theta$ is the phase angle between the voltage and current waveforms.

The average power delivered by an AC system is defined as the amount of power transferred over a given period of time. To calculate this power, you require the RMS values for both the voltage and the current, along with the phase angle that indicates the relationship between these two waveforms.

The root mean square (RMS) value of a waveform is a crucial concept in AC analysis. It represents the equivalent direct current (DC) voltage or current that would generate the same amount of power as the AC waveform. The RMS value is calculated by taking the square root of the average of the squares of the waveform's values over one complete cycle.

The phase angle $\theta$ describes the angular difference between the voltage and current waveforms. Depending on the characteristics of the circuit, this angle can be either positive or negative, indicating whether the voltage leads or lags the current.

The cosine of the phase angle, $\cos(\theta)$, signifies the power factor of the circuit. A power factor of $1$ (or $100\%$) indicates that the voltage and current are perfectly in phase, meaning all the power is effectively delivered to the load. Conversely, a power factor of less than $1$ indicates that some power is lost due to reactive components in the circuit, such as inductors or capacitors.

In summary, to compute the average power delivered by an alternating current, you should first determine the RMS values for both the voltage and the current, ascertain the phase angle between them, and then apply the formula:

$$
P = V_{\text{rms}} I_{\text{rms}} \cos(\theta)
$$
