Forced oscillations arise when an external force is applied to a system, resulting in its vibration. Resonance occurs when the frequency of this external force matches the system's natural frequency, leading to oscillations with significantly increased amplitude.

When an external force varies with time and acts on a system, the system experiences forced oscillations. The amplitude of these oscillations depends on the relationship between the frequency of the external force and the system's natural frequency. Notably, when the frequency of the external force is close to the system's natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillation can become quite large.

Resonance specifically takes place when the frequency of the external force exactly matches the natural frequency of the system. Under these conditions, the amplitude of the oscillation can reach extreme levels, potentially causing damage to the system. This phenomenon is harnessed in various applications, such as in musical instruments, where the instrument's natural frequency is tuned to produce specific desired sounds.

The principles of forced oscillations and resonance are fundamental in many branches of physics, particularly in the study of waves and vibrations. A thorough understanding of these concepts is crucial for designing structures that can endure external forces and for developing devices that utilize resonance to achieve specific effects.
