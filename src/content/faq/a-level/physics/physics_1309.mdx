The observable universe refers to the region of the universe that we can observe from Earth.

Currently, the observable universe is estimated to have a diameter of approximately $93$ billion light-years. This vast distance results from the expansion of the universe, where light from distant celestial objects takes billions of years to reach us, making these objects appear farther away than they truly are. Within the observable universe, we can see a multitude of galaxies, stars, and other celestial bodies through our telescopes. However, it is important to note that there may be significantly more beyond this observable limit that remains unseen.

A key finding in modern cosmology is that not only is the universe expanding, but this expansion is also accelerating. This phenomenon indicates that the observable universe is continuously growing, with objects within it receding from us at increasingly high velocities. This process is referred to as the Hubble expansion, named in honor of the astronomer Edwin Hubble, who was the first to identify this remarkable trend.

The exploration of the observable universe has led to numerous groundbreaking discoveries in both physics and cosmology. By analyzing the light emitted by distant objects, astronomers can glean insights into the universe's history, its composition, and its evolution over time. The observable universe is an expansive and captivating field of study, and many mysteries remain to be uncovered.
