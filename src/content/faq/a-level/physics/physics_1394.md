The electrical resistance of a material tends to increase with temperature.

When an electric current flows through a material, electrons collide with the atoms present in the material, which generates resistance. At elevated temperatures, the atoms vibrate more vigorously, thereby increasing the likelihood of collisions between electrons and atoms. This phenomenon results in a rise in resistance.

This behavior is quantitatively described by the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), which indicates the rate at which resistance changes with temperature. For most materials, the TCR is positive, signifying that resistance increases as temperature rises. Conversely, certain materials, such as superconductors, exhibit a negative TCR, indicating that their resistance decreases as temperature increases.

The TCR can be expressed mathematically using the following formula:

$$
\text{TCR} = \frac{R_2 - R_1}{R_1 \times (T_2 - T_1)}
$$

In this equation, $R_1$ and $R_2$ represent the resistances at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively.

The influence of temperature on resistance has significant practical implications. For example, in electronic circuits, the resistance of components can vary with temperature, potentially affecting the overall performance of the circuit. To address this issue, temperature compensation techniques can be employed to stabilize performance.

In summary, the electrical resistance of a material increases with temperature due to enhanced collisions between electrons and atoms. This effect is characterized by the temperature coefficient of resistance, which is typically positive for most materials. Implementing temperature compensation techniques can help mitigate the impact of temperature fluctuations on resistance in electronic circuits.
