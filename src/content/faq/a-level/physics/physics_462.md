Fluid velocity is inversely related to the diameter of the pipe, as described by the principle of continuity.

According to this principle, the mass flow rate of a fluid must remain constant when it flows through a pipe that has varying diameters. Specifically, when the cross-sectional area of the pipe decreases, the fluid must increase its velocity to maintain the same mass flow rate. Conversely, when the cross-sectional area increases, the fluid can flow at a slower velocity while still keeping the mass flow rate constant. 

Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

$$
A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2
$$

where $A$ represents the cross-sectional area and $v$ represents the fluid velocity at two different points along the pipe. This equation illustrates how a decrease in area ($A_2 < A_1$) leads to an increase in velocity ($v_2 > v_1$), while an increase in area allows for a slower velocity.
