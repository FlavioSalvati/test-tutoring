The theory of cosmic inflation posits that the universe experienced a period of rapid expansion during its earliest moments.

Specifically, cosmic inflation suggests that the universe underwent exponential growth within the first fraction of a second following the Big Bang. This swift expansion was driven by a theoretical construct known as the inflaton field, which allowed the universe to expand at a rate exceeding the speed of light. This extraordinary expansion smoothed out the cosmos, resulting in a more homogeneous and isotropic universe, while also generating the initial conditions necessary for the formation of galaxies and other large-scale structures.

Proposed in the 1980s, the theory of cosmic inflation was developed to address several significant puzzles in cosmology, including the horizon problem and the flatness problem. The horizon problem arises from the observation that different regions of the universe, which are now widely separated, were once in causal contact during the early universe yet exhibit the same temperature and other physical properties. Meanwhile, the flatness problem highlights the surprising observation that the universe appears nearly flat, a condition that suggests a highly fine-tuned set of initial conditions.

Evidence supporting cosmic inflation comes from various sources, including the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe. However, the theory also raises new questions, such as the nature of the inflaton field and the mechanisms that ended the inflationary period, subsequently triggering the hot Big Bang. These inquiries remain active areas of research within the field of cosmology.
