Wavelength refers to the distance between two consecutive points on a wave that are in phase, meaning they are at the same stage of their oscillation.

In the field of physics, a wave is defined as a disturbance that propagates through space and time, facilitating the transfer of energy without the movement of matter. Waves can be characterized by several key properties, including wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and speed. The wavelength, denoted by the Greek letter $\lambda$, is specifically the distance between two consecutive points on a wave that are in phase. This distance is typically measured in meters.

Wavelength is a crucial attribute of waves as it influences both the type of wave and its behavior. For instance, electromagnetic waves—including light and radio waves—exhibit varying wavelengths that correspond to different colors or frequencies. Longer wavelengths are associated with lower frequencies, while shorter wavelengths correspond to higher frequencies. Similarly, in the case of sound waves, different wavelengths determine the pitch of the sound; longer wavelengths yield lower pitches, whereas shorter wavelengths produce higher pitches.

Beyond defining the type and behavior of waves, wavelength plays a significant role in wave interference. When two waves with identical wavelengths interact, they can either amplify each other (constructive interference) or diminish each other (destructive interference). This phenomenon has practical applications in various technologies, such as noise-canceling headphones and musical instruments.
