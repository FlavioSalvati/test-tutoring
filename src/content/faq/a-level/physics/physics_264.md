The life cycle of a star is intricately linked to its mass.

Stars originate from vast clouds of gas and dust known as nebulae. The force of gravity causes these nebulae to contract, giving rise to a protostar. The mass of the protostar plays a crucial role in determining its evolutionary path. If the mass of the protostar is less than $0.08$ solar masses, it will develop into a brown dwarf, which never initiates nuclear fusion. For protostars with a mass between $0.08$ and $0.4$ solar masses, they evolve into red dwarfs that burn hydrogen at a slow rate for billions of years.

When the protostar's mass exceeds $0.4$ solar masses, it becomes a main sequence star, similar to our Sun. In this phase, the star fuses hydrogen into helium within its core, thereby releasing energy that creates an outward pressure. This pressure counteracts the inward pull of gravity. Notably, more massive stars are hotter, brighter, and consume their fuel at a much faster rate.

Once a main sequence star depletes its hydrogen fuel, it transitions to fusing helium into heavier elements. This process leads to the star expanding into a red giant. Subsequently, it expels its outer layers, resulting in the formation of a planetary nebula. The remnant core of the star, now a white dwarf, gradually cools over the course of billions of years.

In contrast, stars with a mass greater than $8$ solar masses culminate their life cycles with a supernova explosion. During this event, the core collapses into either a neutron star or a black hole, while the outer layers are ejected into space. The elements produced in the supernova enrich the interstellar medium, providing essential materials for the formation of future generations of stars.
