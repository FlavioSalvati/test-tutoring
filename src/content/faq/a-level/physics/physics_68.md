The Doppler effect describes the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave as a result of the relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.

This phenomenon is observable across all types of waves, including sound waves, light waves, and water waves. When a wave source approaches an observer, the frequency of the wave appears to increase, which leads to a higher pitch or a shorter wavelength. In contrast, when the wave source moves away from the observer, the frequency appears to decrease, resulting in a lower pitch or a longer wavelength.

The Doppler effect has numerous practical applications. It is utilized in radar and sonar systems to determine the speed and direction of moving objects. Additionally, in the field of astronomy, it helps scientists assess the motion of stars and galaxies.

Mathematically, the Doppler effect can be represented by the following equation:

$$
f' = f \frac{(v \pm v_0)}{(v \pm v_s)}
$$

In this equation, $f$ represents the frequency of the wave, $v$ is the speed of the wave in the medium, $v_0$ denotes the speed of the observer, and $v_s$ is the speed of the source. The choice of the plus or minus sign depends on whether the source is moving towards or away from the observer.

In summary, the Doppler effect is a fundamental concept in wave physics with a wide range of applications across various fields.
