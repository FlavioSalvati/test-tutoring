The evolutionary stages of a high-mass star include protostar, main sequence, red supergiant, supernova, and ultimately either a neutron star or a black hole.

A high-mass star begins its life cycle as a protostar. This stage involves a dense cloud of gas and dust that collapses under its own gravitational force. As the protostar continues to contract, it becomes increasingly dense and hot. At this point, nuclear fusion reactions initiate in its core, marking the transition to the main sequence phase. During this phase, the star primarily fuses hydrogen into helium, a process that releases energy to counterbalance the gravitational forces acting to compress the star.

Once the hydrogen fuel in the core is depleted, the star undergoes expansion and cooling, transforming into a red supergiant. In this phase, the star begins to fuse heavier elements in its core, generating energy while simultaneously producing heavier elements through nuclear fusion processes.

Eventually, the star reaches the end of its life and undergoes a dramatic explosion known as a supernova. This violent event releases an immense amount of energy and creates heavy elements in the process. Following the explosion, the core of the star collapses, leading to the formation of either a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the original mass of the star.

Neutron stars are incredibly dense, possessing a mass greater than that of the Sun but with a radius of only a few kilometers. In contrast, black holes are even denser, exhibiting a gravitational pull so intense that not even light can escape their grasp.

Understanding the evolution of high-mass stars is crucial for comprehending the formation of heavy elements and the significant role supernovae play in shaping the universe.
