The right-hand rule and the left-hand rule are essential tools in electromagnetism for determining the directions of magnetic fields and currents.

The **right-hand rule** is utilized to identify the direction of the magnetic field surrounding a current-carrying wire. To apply this rule, wrap your right hand around the wire so that your thumb points in the direction of the current. Your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines. This rule can also be employed to ascertain the direction of the force acting on a current-carrying wire when it is placed in a magnetic field.

Conversely, the **left-hand rule** is used to find the direction of the force experienced by a charged particle moving within a magnetic field. To use this rule, extend your left hand with your thumb pointing in the direction of the particle's velocity and your fingers pointing in the direction of the magnetic field. The orientation of your palm will indicate the direction of the force acting on the charged particle.

Both the right-hand and left-hand rules are crucial for understanding the principles of electromagnetism and are widely applied in physics calculations and experiments. It is important to remember that the directions of the magnetic field and the force on a charged particle are always perpendicular to each other.
