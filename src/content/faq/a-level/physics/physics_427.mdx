To calculate the displacement in simple harmonic motion at a specific time, you can use the equation:

$$
x = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)
$$

In simple harmonic motion, an object oscillates back and forth around an equilibrium position with a constant amplitude and period. The displacement of the object at any given time can be determined using the formula above, where:

- $x$ represents the displacement,
- $A$ is the amplitude,
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency (given by $\omega = 2\pi f$, with $f$ being the frequency),
- $t$ is the time,
- $\phi$ is the phase angle.

To effectively use this equation, you must first establish the values for $A$, $\omega$, and $\phi$. 

1. **Amplitude ($A$):** This is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position and can either be measured directly or provided in the problem.

2. **Angular Frequency ($\omega$):** This can be calculated from the period of the motion ($T = \frac{1}{f}$) using the formula:
   $$ 
   \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} 
   $$

3. **Phase Angle ($\phi$):** This initial phase angle may be given in the problem or determined based on the initial conditions of the motion.

Once you have determined these values, substitute them into the equation:

$$
x = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)
$$

By inputting the specific value of time $t$, you can solve for $x$, which will yield the displacement of the object at that precise moment in its simple harmonic motion.
