The relationship between the peak current of an alternating current (AC) and its root mean square (RMS) value can be expressed through a straightforward mathematical formula.

The RMS value of an AC signal represents the equivalent direct current (DC) value that produces the same heating effect in a resistor as the AC signal. It is determined by calculating the square root of the average of the squares of the instantaneous values of the AC over one complete cycle. In contrast, the peak value of an AC signal refers to the maximum current observed over that same cycle. The relationship between the peak current and the RMS value is articulated by the formula:

$$
I_{\text{peak}} = \sqrt{2} \times I_{\text{RMS}}
$$

This formula can be derived by analyzing the power dissipated in a resistor by the AC current. Since the power dissipated is proportional to the square of the current, the RMS value is utilized in these calculations. However, knowing the peak current value is also critical because it helps determine the maximum voltage a circuit can withstand.

In practical applications, the RMS value serves as the standard for rating electrical equipment, such as motors and transformers. Meanwhile, the peak value is crucial for circuit design and for selecting components capable of managing the maximum voltage and current levels anticipated in operation. Understanding the relationship between these two values is vital for anyone involved in working with AC circuits.
