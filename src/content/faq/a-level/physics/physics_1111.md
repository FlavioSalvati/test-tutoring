To determine the total current in a series DC circuit, you simply sum the individual currents flowing through each component.

In a series DC circuit, all components are connected in a single path, which means that the current remains constant throughout the entire circuit. Therefore, the total current can be calculated by adding the individual currents. To find these individual currents, you can apply Ohm's Law, which is expressed as:

$$ I = \frac{V}{R} $$

where:
- $I$ represents the current,
- $V$ represents the voltage, and
- $R$ represents the resistance.

For instance, consider a circuit with three resistors connected in series, each having a resistance of $10 \, \Omega$, and powered by a voltage source of $12 \, V$. The total current can be calculated as follows:

1. **Calculate the total resistance**:
   $$ R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \, \Omega $$

2. **Use Ohm's Law to find the current through each resistor**:
   $$ I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{12}{10} = 1.2 \, \text{amps} $$

3. **Since the current remains the same throughout the circuit**, the total current is simply the sum of the individual currents:
   $$ I_{\text{total}} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = 1.2 + 1.2 + 1.2 = 3.6 \, \text{amps} $$

It is crucial to understand that in a series circuit, the voltage is divided among the resistors, resulting in different voltage drops across each resistor. However, the current remains constant throughout the entire circuit.
