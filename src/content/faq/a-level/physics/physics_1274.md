Absolute uncertainty refers to the range of values within which the true value of a measurement is expected to lie. 

In any measurement process, there is an inherent degree of uncertainty stemming from the limitations of the measuring instrument and the skill of the experimenter. Absolute uncertainty quantifies this uncertainty by providing a range around a measured value, expressed with a certain level of confidence. Typically, it is conveyed in the same units as the measurement itself.

To calculate absolute uncertainty, one can take the difference between the maximum and minimum values from a set of measurements, and then divide that difference by two. For instance, if a length is measured as $10.5 \, \text{cm} \pm 0.2 \, \text{cm}$, the absolute uncertainty is $0.1 \, \text{cm}$. This indicates that the true value of the length lies between $10.4 \, \text{cm}$ and $10.6 \, \text{cm}$, with a confidence level of $95\%$.

Understanding absolute uncertainty is crucial in the field of physics, as it directly influences the accuracy and precision of experimental results. It also plays a key role in determining the number of significant figures in a measurement; the uncertainty indicates the last digit that can be reliably reported. By recognizing and minimizing absolute uncertainty, physicists can enhance the reliability and validity of their measurements and experimental findings.
