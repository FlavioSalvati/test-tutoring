Intrinsic semiconductors are pure semiconductor materials, whereas extrinsic semiconductors are intentionally doped with impurities to modify their electrical properties.

Intrinsic semiconductors, such as silicon ($Si$) and germanium ($Ge$), possess an equal number of electrons and holes, resulting in limited conductivity at room temperature. However, when energy is supplied to these materials—via heat or light—electrons can be excited into the conduction band. This excitation generates free charge carriers, thereby enhancing the conductivity of the material.

Extrinsic semiconductors are produced by deliberately introducing impurities, known as dopants, into the pure semiconductor. This process, referred to as doping, typically involves elements such as boron ($B$) or phosphorus ($P$). Doping alters the balance of charge carriers: for instance, when boron is added to silicon, it forms a p-type semiconductor. In this case, boron has one fewer electron than silicon, resulting in the creation of holes. Conversely, when phosphorus is added to silicon, it produces an n-type semiconductor, as phosphorus has one extra electron compared to silicon, leading to an abundance of electrons.

The ability to manipulate conductivity through doping is crucial for the development of modern electronic devices, including transistors and diodes. By combining p-type and n-type semiconductors, a p-n junction is formed, which facilitates the controlled flow of electric current and enables the construction of complex electronic circuits.
