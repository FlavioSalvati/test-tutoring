Alpha radiation consists of helium nuclei, beta radiation comprises high-energy electrons, and gamma radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation.

Among these three types, alpha radiation is the least penetrating. It can be effectively stopped by a sheet of paper or by a few centimeters of air. However, it is highly ionizing, which means it can strip electrons from atoms and molecules, potentially causing significant damage to living tissue. Alpha radiation is typically emitted by heavy, unstable nuclei such as those found in uranium and radium.

Beta radiation, on the other hand, is more penetrating than alpha radiation and can be halted by a few millimeters of aluminum. Although it is also ionizing, its ionizing capability is lower than that of alpha radiation. Beta particles are emitted by unstable nuclei that possess an excess of neutrons or protons, and this emission aids in stabilizing the nucleus.

Gamma radiation is the most penetrating type of radiation and requires thick layers of concrete or lead for effective shielding. While gamma radiation is not ionizing in itself, its high energy can cause damage to living tissue by disrupting chemical bonds. Gamma rays are emitted when the nucleus of an atom transitions from an excited state to a lower energy state, helping to stabilize the nucleus.

In summary, alpha radiation is the least penetrating but the most ionizing; beta radiation is more penetrating but less ionizing; and gamma radiation is the most penetrating and non-ionizing.
