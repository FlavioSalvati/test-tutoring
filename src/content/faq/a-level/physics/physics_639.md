Potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy in a free-falling object as a result of the gravitational force acting on it.

When an object is elevated to a certain height, it accumulates potential energy due to the work performed against gravity. This stored potential energy can be converted into kinetic energy when the object is released and allowed to fall freely. As the object descends, its potential energy decreases while its kinetic energy, which is the energy associated with motion, increases.

The transformation of potential energy into kinetic energy is governed by the law of conservation of energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change from one form to another. As the object falls, the decrease in potential energy is exactly balanced by the increase in kinetic energy, ensuring that the total energy of the system remains constant.

The rate at which potential energy is converted into kinetic energy is influenced by both the mass of the object and the height from which it is dropped. Heavier objects and those dropped from greater heights will yield a higher kinetic energy upon reaching the ground. Moreover, the object's speed increases as potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, continuing to rise until it reaches a maximum velocity known as terminal velocity.

In summary, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy in a free-falling object due to gravity, with this conversion adhering to the principle of conservation of energy. The rate of this conversion is dependent on the object's mass and the height from which it falls, and the object's speed continues to increase until it reaches terminal velocity.
