A hadron collider is a specialized type of particle accelerator that facilitates the collision of hadrons, which include protons and neutrons.

These colliders serve as crucial instruments in the study of the fundamental building blocks of matter. They operate by utilizing electromagnetic fields to accelerate beams of particles—such as protons or heavy ions—to extremely high velocities. Once accelerated, these beams are directed to collide with one another, resulting in a cascade of subatomic particles. This shower of particles can then be analyzed using sophisticated detectors.

The most renowned hadron collider is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located at CERN in Switzerland. The LHC holds the distinction of being the largest and most powerful particle accelerator globally, with a circumference of $27 \, \text{km}$. It plays a pivotal role in investigating the properties of the Higgs boson, the particle that imparts mass to other particles. Additionally, the LHC is instrumental in the quest to discover new particles and phenomena that lie beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.

Hadron colliders are invaluable tools for physicists, as they enable the exploration of subatomic particles and the fundamental forces that govern their interactions. By colliding particles at high energies, researchers can replicate conditions that prevailed in the early universe, allowing for the examination of matter and energy in extreme environments. This research not only enhances our understanding of the universe but also has the potential to foster new technologies and applications in diverse fields, such as medicine and energy.
