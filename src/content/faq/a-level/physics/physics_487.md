A spark chamber is an instrument used to detect charged particles by ionizing the gas molecules within it, resulting in a visible spark along the particle's trajectory.

When a charged particle traverses a gas-filled spark chamber, it ionizes the gas molecules in its path. This ionization generates a trail of charged particles, which manifests as a visible spark. The spark chamber consists of a gas-filled enclosure equipped with two parallel metal plates, with one plate connected to a high-voltage source. As a charged particle moves through the chamber, it ionizes the surrounding gas molecules, creating a trail of ions that are drawn toward the high-voltage plate. As these charged particles approach the plate, they collide with additional gas molecules, leading to further ionization and resulting in the production of a visible spark.

Spark chambers are widely employed in particle physics experiments to detect and trace the trajectories of charged particles. By examining the patterns of sparks generated within the chamber, physicists can ascertain various properties of the particles, such as their charge, momentum, and energy. Although spark chambers have largely been supplanted by more sophisticated particle detectors, such as drift chambers and time projection chambers, they continue to play a vital role in particle physics research.
