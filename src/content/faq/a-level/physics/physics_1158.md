The dimensions of an atomic nucleus are determined through scattering experiments involving high-energy particles.

To ascertain the size of a nucleus, scientists employ scattering experiments that utilize high-energy particles, such as electrons or protons. In these experiments, particles are directed toward the nucleus, and the resulting scattering behavior is analyzed to extract information about the nucleus's size.

One prominent technique for measuring nuclear size is electron scattering. In this approach, a beam of high-energy electrons is aimed at the nucleus, and the electrons that scatter off the nucleus are subsequently detected. By examining the scattering pattern, researchers can infer the dimensions of the nucleus.

Similarly, proton scattering involves directing a beam of high-energy protons at the nucleus. The protons that scatter off the nucleus are detected, and the analysis of their scattering pattern allows scientists to determine the nucleus's size.

Additionally, the size of a nucleus can be inferred from the energy levels of its constituent particles. By measuring these energy levels, researchers can calculate the dimensions of the nucleus.

In summary, measuring the size of a nucleus is a crucial aspect of nuclear physics, contributing to our understanding of the properties and behaviors of atomic nuclei.
