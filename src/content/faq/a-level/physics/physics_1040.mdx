Errors and uncertainties are fundamental concepts in measurement that impact the reliability of results. 

An **error** refers to a mistake made during the measurement process, which can lead to inaccurate outcomes. Errors can be categorized as either systematic or random. Systematic errors arise from consistent issues, such as faulty instruments or incorrect calibration, and can often be corrected. Conversely, random errors occur due to unpredictable factors, such as human mistakes or variations in environmental conditions. Although random errors cannot be eliminated, their impact can be minimized by taking multiple measurements and calculating the average.

**Uncertainty**, on the other hand, represents the range of possible values that a measurement could assume, reflecting the inherent limitations in the measurement process. Sources of uncertainty may include the precision of the measuring instrument, the accuracy of the measurement, and the skill level of the person conducting the measurement. Uncertainty can be quantified as a percentage or expressed as a range of values. It is crucial to consider uncertainty when reporting measurement results to provide a clearer picture of their reliability.

In conclusion, errors are mistakes that can lead to inaccurate results, while uncertainty reflects the potential variability in those results due to measurement limitations. Understanding and accounting for both errors and uncertainties is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of reported measurements.
