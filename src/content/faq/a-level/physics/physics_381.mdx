The phase difference between voltage and current fluctuates within an alternating current (AC) circuit.

In an AC circuit, both voltage and current continuously change in direction and magnitude. The relationship between these two quantities is characterized by their phase difference, which is defined as the angle between the voltage and current waveforms. This angle can be measured in degrees or radians.

When the voltage and current are in phase, they achieve their maximum and minimum values simultaneously. This alignment corresponds to a phase difference of $0^\circ$. In this scenario, the power factor is equal to $1$, indicating that all the power supplied by the source is effectively utilized by the load.

Conversely, when the voltage and current are out of phase, they do not reach their peak and trough values at the same time. This misalignment results in a phase difference greater than $0^\circ$. In such cases, the power factor falls below $1$, signifying that a portion of the power supplied by the source is not being utilized by the load.

The phase difference between voltage and current can be determined using trigonometric principles. Specifically, the cosine of the phase angle is equivalent to the power factor. Additionally, phase differences can be accurately measured with the help of an oscilloscope, which visualizes the voltage and current waveforms on a display screen.

In summary, the phase difference between voltage and current in an AC circuit varies based on their alignment. When they are in phase, the power factor is $1$, while when they are out of phase, the power factor is less than $1$. This phase difference can be calculated through trigonometry or measured using an oscilloscope.
