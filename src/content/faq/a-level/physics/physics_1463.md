To determine the electric field generated by a point charge, we utilize the equation:

$$
E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}
$$

where:

- $E$ represents the electric field,
- $k$ is Coulomb's constant, approximately equal to $9 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2$,
- $Q$ denotes the magnitude of the point charge, and
- $r$ is the distance from the charge to the point where the electric field is being measured.

The electric field is a vector quantity that indicates the force exerted on a charged particle within an electric field. The electric field produced by a point charge radiates outward from positive charges and inward toward negative charges, illustrating its radial direction. As one moves further away from the point charge, the magnitude of the electric field decreases according to the inverse square law.

It is essential to recognize that when dealing with multiple point charges, the total electric field can be determined by vectorially adding the electric fields produced by each individual charge. For scenarios involving continuous charge distributions, integration techniques are employed to compute the electric field.

Understanding how to accurately calculate electric fields is crucial across various domains of physics, particularly in electromagnetism and electrostatics. This knowledge enables predictions regarding the behavior of charged particles within electric fields and aids in the design of electrical devices.
