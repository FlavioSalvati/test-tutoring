Elastic potential energy is fundamentally connected to the work done on a spring, as described by the formula 

$$
W = \frac{1}{2} k x^2.
$$

When a spring is either stretched or compressed, it accumulates potential energy due to its elastic properties. This stored energy is referred to as elastic potential energy. Importantly, the amount of elastic potential energy within a spring is directly proportional to the extent of its deformation or displacement from its equilibrium position. In other words, the greater the stretch or compression of the spring, the more potential energy it retains.

When an external force is applied to the spring, work is performed on it. The work done is equivalent to the elastic potential energy that the spring stores. The relationship is articulated in the formula 

$$
W = \frac{1}{2} k x^2,
$$ 

where $k$ represents the spring constant and $x$ indicates the displacement from the equilibrium position. This equation illustrates that the work done on the spring increases with the level of deformation or displacement.

In summary, elastic potential energy is intricately linked to the work performed, as encapsulated in the equation 

$$
W = \frac{1}{2} k x^2.
$$ 

When an external force acts on a spring, the work done is equal to the elastic potential energy stored in it. As the spring is stretched or compressed further, it stores more potential energy, necessitating more work to achieve the deformation.
