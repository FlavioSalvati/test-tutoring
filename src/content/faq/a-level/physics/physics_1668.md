The mass of a particle can be determined using a variety of experimental techniques and theoretical calculations.

One common experimental approach involves the use of a particle accelerator. In this method, particles are accelerated to high speeds and then collide with a target. By measuring the momentum and energy of the particles both before and after the collision, researchers can calculate the mass of the particles based on the principles of conservation of momentum and energy.

Another experimental technique utilizes a cloud chamber. In this setup, charged particles traveling through a gas create a trail of ionization. By analyzing the curvature of this trail within a magnetic field, and knowing the strength of that magnetic field, the mass of the particle can be deduced.

Theoretical calculations are also crucial in determining particle mass. For instance, the mass of the Higgs boson was predicted using the Standard Model of particle physics. This model incorporates the properties and interactions of known particles, allowing physicists to estimate the mass of the Higgs boson before it was experimentally confirmed.

Moreover, the mass of a particle can be inferred from its decay products. By measuring the energy and momentum of these decay products, one can apply conservation laws to calculate the mass of the original particle.

In summary, determining the mass of a particle requires a blend of experimental techniques and theoretical insights. This process is fundamental to our understanding of particle properties and behaviors in the universe.
