A star transitions off the main sequence when it exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core.

During its main sequence phase, a star exists in a state of equilibrium where the energy generated through nuclear fusion in the core is balanced by the energy radiated from its surface. This fusion process transforms hydrogen into helium, releasing energy in the form of light and heat. As the star depletes its hydrogen supply, the core contracts and its temperature rises, which results in the expansion and cooling of the outer layers. This outward expansion signals the star's departure from the main sequence, leading it into a new phase of its life cycle.

The specific trajectory a star follows after leaving the main sequence is largely determined by its mass. Low-mass stars, such as our Sun, will evolve into red giants as they begin to fuse helium in their cores. Conversely, high-mass stars will undergo a series of fusion reactions that create heavier elements, ultimately culminating in a supernova explosion.

The departure of a star from the main sequence is observable through significant changes in its brightness and color. As the star expands and cools, it becomes redder and more luminous, making it easier to detect with telescopes. Understanding the life cycle of stars is crucial for comprehending the evolution of the universe and the formation of the elements essential for life.
