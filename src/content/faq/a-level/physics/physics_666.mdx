Bosons are a category of particles that adhere to Bose-Einstein statistics and possess integer spin. They play a crucial role in mediating the fundamental forces of nature. There are four primary types of bosons, each exhibiting distinct properties:

1. **Gauge Bosons**: These particles are responsible for mediating the fundamental forces: electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. The photon serves as the gauge boson for electromagnetism, while the W and Z bosons mediate the weak force. Additionally, gluons are the gauge bosons associated with the strong force.

2. **Higgs Boson**: This particle is pivotal in providing mass to other particles. It is the only scalar boson and was famously discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider, confirming its essential role in the Standard Model of particle physics.

3. **W and Z Bosons**: These bosons mediate the weak force, which is responsible for processes such as radioactive decay. Notably, the W and Z bosons are the heaviest among the bosons and were discovered in 1983.

4. **Gravitons**: While still hypothetical, gravitons are theorized to mediate the force of gravity. Despite their predicted existence, they have not yet been observed. The concept of gravitons arises from various theoretical frameworks, including string theory.

In summary, the four types of bosons—gauge bosons, the Higgs boson, W and Z bosons, and gravitons—each possess unique characteristics and play vital roles in mediating fundamental forces and imparting mass to particles.
