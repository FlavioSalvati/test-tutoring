Energy transformation in a pendulum involves the continuous conversion between potential energy and kinetic energy.

At the highest point of its swing, the pendulum possesses maximum potential energy. As it descends, this potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy, which reaches its peak at the lowest point of the swing, where potential energy is at its minimum. When the pendulum ascends again, kinetic energy is converted back into potential energy, and this cycle of energy transformation repeats indefinitely.

This process adheres to the law of conservation of energy, which asserts that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred or converted from one form to another. In the context of a pendulum, while the total energy remains constant, it continuously shifts between potential and kinetic forms.

The efficiency of a pendulum's motion can be influenced by factors such as air resistance and friction, which may result in some energy being lost as heat. However, in an idealized system devoid of external forces, the energy transformation within a pendulum would be perfectly efficient, with no energy loss occurring.
