Real depth refers to the actual distance from the surface of an object to its deepest point. It is a measurable quantity that remains constant, regardless of the observer's position or the medium through which the object is viewed. For instance, the real depth of a swimming pool is the vertical distance from the water's surface to the bottom of the pool.

In contrast, apparent depth is the distance from the surface of an object to the point where it seems to be located. This perceived distance is influenced by the refractive index of the medium in which the object is observed, as well as the observer's position. A common example of this phenomenon can be seen when a stick is partially submerged in water; it appears bent due to the different refractive indices of air and water. This optical effect is a classic illustration of refraction, where light changes direction as it transitions between mediums, thereby altering our perception of depth.
