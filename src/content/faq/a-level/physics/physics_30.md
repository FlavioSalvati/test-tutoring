The redshift of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from Earth.

Redshift occurs due to the Doppler effect, which happens when an object emitting light moves away from an observer. As the object recedes, the wavelength of its emitted light appears longer, shifting towards the red end of the spectrum. This redshift is directly proportional to both the velocity of the object and the distance separating the observer from the object.

In the context of galaxies, redshift is primarily a consequence of the expanding universe. As the universe expands, galaxies drift away from one another, resulting in the redshift of their light. Notably, the farther a galaxy is from Earth, the faster it seems to be receding, which in turn leads to a greater redshift.

Astronomers leverage the correlation between redshift and distance to estimate how far galaxies are from us. By measuring the redshift of a galaxy, they can ascertain its velocity and subsequently its distance. This principle is encapsulated in Hubble's Law, named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, who first identified this relationship in the 1920s.

In summary, the redshift of a galaxy is directly proportional to its distance from Earth due to the expansion of the universe. This relationship serves as a crucial tool for scientists in estimating the distances to galaxies through Hubble's Law.
