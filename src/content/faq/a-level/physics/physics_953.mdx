Radiation sickness can manifest a variety of symptoms and lead to significant long-term health consequences.

When an individual is exposed to high levels of radiation, their cells may sustain damage or even be destroyed. This damage can result in numerous symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and skin burns. In more severe instances, radiation sickness may also inflict harm on the central nervous system, potentially causing seizures, coma, or even death.

The intensity of radiation sickness is influenced by several factors, including the type of radiation, the dose received, and the duration of exposure. Individuals subjected to high doses of radiation over a brief period are more likely to experience acute and severe symptoms. Conversely, those exposed to lower doses over an extended duration may develop symptoms more gradually.

In addition to the immediate effects of radiation sickness, there are significant long-term health risks to consider. Radiation exposure is known to elevate the likelihood of developing certain cancers, such as leukemia and thyroid cancer. It can also induce genetic mutations that may be transmitted to subsequent generations.

In summary, radiation sickness is a serious medical condition with both immediate and enduring health implications. It is crucial to implement protective measures against radiation exposure, such as wearing appropriate protective clothing and equipment, and adhering to safety protocols when working with radioactive materials.
