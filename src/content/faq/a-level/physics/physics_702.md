The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) exhibits several significant properties, including its temperature, isotropy, and blackbody spectrum.

The temperature of the CMB is approximately $2.7 \, \text{K}$, which corresponds to about $-270.45 \, \text{Â°C}$. This temperature is remarkably uniform across the sky, with only slight variations on the order of one part in $100,000$. This uniformity is referred to as isotropy and serves as a crucial piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory.

In addition to its uniform temperature, the CMB possesses a blackbody spectrum. This means that the intensity of the radiation at various wavelengths adheres to a specific distribution that matches the radiation emitted by a perfect blackbody at a temperature of $2.7 \, \text{K}$. The characteristics of this blackbody spectrum further reinforce the validity of the Big Bang theory.

The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation occurred in $1964$ by researchers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in $1978$ for their groundbreaking work. The CMB is understood to be the residual radiation from the Big Bang, which transpired approximately $13.8$ billion years ago. The properties of the CMB offer crucial insights into the conditions of the early universe and its subsequent evolution.
