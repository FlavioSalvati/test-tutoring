The period and frequency in simple harmonic motion are inversely related.

In simple harmonic motion, an object oscillates back and forth in a periodic manner. The **period**, denoted as $T$, is the time required to complete one full oscillation, while the **frequency**, denoted as $f$, is the number of oscillations that occur in one second. The key relationship between period and frequency is that they are inversely proportional. This implies that as the period increases, the frequency decreases, and vice versa.

Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed with the equation:

$$
T = \frac{1}{f}
$$

where $T$ is the period and $f$ is the frequency. This equation illustrates that if the frequency is doubled, the period is halved. Conversely, if the frequency is halved, the period is doubled.

Understanding the relationship between period and frequency is crucial in the study of simple harmonic motion. For instance, if the period of a pendulum is known, the frequency can be determined using the equation:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$

Similarly, if the frequency of a sound wave is known, the period can be calculated using the same formula.

In summary, the period and frequency in simple harmonic motion are inversely proportional. Grasping this relationship is essential in various fields of physics, encompassing mechanics and wave phenomena.
