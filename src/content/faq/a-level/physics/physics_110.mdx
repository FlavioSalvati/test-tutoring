Diodes are electronic components that permit current to flow in one direction while blocking it in the opposite direction. They are constructed from semiconductor materials, typically silicon, and feature a p-n junction. The p-type semiconductor contains an abundance of positively charged holes, whereas the n-type semiconductor has a surplus of negatively charged electrons. When these two materials are joined, the holes and electrons diffuse across the junction, forming a depletion region that lacks free charge carriers.

When a voltage is applied to the diode in the forward direction—meaning the positive terminal is connected to the p-type material and the negative terminal to the n-type material—the depletion region narrows. This allows the holes and electrons to recombine, thus enabling current to flow through the diode. Conversely, when a voltage is applied in the reverse direction (with the positive terminal connected to the n-type material and the negative terminal to the p-type material), the depletion region widens, preventing any current from flowing.

Diodes have a wide range of applications in electronic circuits, including rectification, voltage regulation, and signal modulation. They are commonly used to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), protect sensitive components from reverse voltage, and limit signal amplitude. Additionally, diodes exhibit non-linear characteristics that can be utilized for various functions such as clipping, switching, and mixing. A thorough understanding of diode behavior is crucial for the design and analysis of electronic circuits.
