Isotopes are carefully chosen for use in nuclear medicine based on their half-lives and decay characteristics.

In nuclear medicine, it is crucial that isotopes possess an appropriate half-life, which is defined as the duration required for half of the radioactive nuclei to undergo decay. If an isotope has a half-life that is too short, it may decay before it can be effectively utilized for imaging or therapeutic purposes. Conversely, an isotope with a half-life that is excessively long may expose the patient to unnecessary radiation for an extended period. Consequently, isotopes with half-lives ranging from a few minutes to several days are generally preferred.

Another critical consideration is the type of radiation emitted during the decay process. Isotopes intended for imaging typically emit gamma rays, which can be detected by gamma cameras. In contrast, isotopes used for therapeutic applications emit alpha or beta particles, which can penetrate tissues and effectively target cancer cells. The energy of the emitted radiation is also significant, as it influences the depth of penetration and the amount of radiation absorbed by the patient.

Additionally, isotopes must be produced in adequate quantities and at a reasonable cost. Some isotopes are generated in nuclear reactors, while others are produced using particle accelerators. It is essential that the production processes are reliable and efficient to ensure a consistent supply of isotopes for medical applications.

In summary, the selection of isotopes for nuclear medicine requires a comprehensive evaluation of their half-lives, decay properties, radiation type and energy, as well as considerations related to production feasibility and cost.
