A rectifier is a device that converts alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC), while an inverter performs the reverse function by converting direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC).

Rectifiers are electronic devices that utilize diodes to ensure that current flows in only one direction. This process effectively transforms AC, which periodically reverses direction, into DC, which flows consistently in a single direction. Rectifiers are essential components in various applications, including power supplies for electronic devices like laptops and mobile phones, as well as in industrial settings where DC power is necessary.

Conversely, inverters are electronic devices that convert DC into AC. They achieve this by employing electronic switches that rapidly change the polarity of the DC voltage, thereby generating an AC waveform. Inverters play a crucial role in renewable energy systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines, where they convert the DC power produced by these energy sources into AC power suitable for use in homes and businesses.

In summary, rectifiers and inverters serve opposite functions in electrical power conversion. Rectifiers transform AC into DC, while inverters convert DC into AC. Understanding the distinct roles of these devices is vital for anyone studying electrical engineering or physics, as they are fundamental components in a wide range of electronic systems.
