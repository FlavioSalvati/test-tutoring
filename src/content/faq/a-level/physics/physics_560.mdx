To calculate gravitational potential energy, you can use the formula 

$$
E = mgh,
$$ 

where: 
- $m$ is the mass of the object, 
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and 
- $h$ is the height of the object above a reference point.

Gravitational potential energy is the energy that an object possesses as a result of its position within a gravitational field. This energy is measured in joules (J) and can be computed using the formula 

$$
E = mgh,
$$ 

where:
- $m$ represents the mass of the object,
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$ on the surface of the Earth), and 
- $h$ denotes the height of the object above a chosen reference point.

To apply this formula, you must know both the mass of the object and its height relative to the reference point. The reference point is typically set at ground level or another fixed location. 

For instance, consider a $2 \, \text{kg}$ object positioned on a shelf that is $3 \, \text{m}$ above the ground. The gravitational potential energy of this object can be calculated as follows:

$$
E = mgh = 2 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times 3 \, \text{m} = 58.86 \, \text{J}.
$$

This calculation indicates that the object possesses $58.86 \, \text{J}$ of potential energy due to its elevated position within the gravitational field. This energy can subsequently be transformed into other forms, such as kinetic energy, should the object be permitted to fall.

It is important to understand that gravitational potential energy is a relative quantity; it depends on the choice of reference point. If you select a different reference point, the calculated gravitational potential energy of the object will change accordingly.
