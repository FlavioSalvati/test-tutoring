Semiconductors offer distinct advantages over conductors in the realm of electronics, primarily due to their capacity to regulate current flow.

Semiconductors are materials that possess electrical conductivity levels that fall between those of conductors and insulators. Their unique properties make them essential in the electronics industry. One of the key advantages of semiconductors, as compared to conductors, is their ability to control current flow. This control is achieved by introducing impurities into the semiconductor through a process known as doping. Doping creates an imbalance in the number of electrons, resulting in the formation of two types of semiconductors: p-type, which has an excess of holes (positive charge carriers), and n-type, which has an excess of electrons (negative charge carriers).

In addition to current control, semiconductors excel at amplifying signals. This capability is realized through the use of transistors, which are composed of three layers of semiconductor material. By managing the flow of current between these layers, transistors can effectively amplify signals and function as electronic switches.
