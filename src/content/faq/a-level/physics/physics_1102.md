Active components necessitate an energy source, whereas passive components operate independently of an energy supply.

Active electronic components, such as transistors and integrated circuits, require an external energy source to function effectively. These components can amplify signals, generate oscillations, and execute various signal processing tasks. Additionally, active components are capable of switching signals on and off, which makes them essential in digital circuits.

In contrast, passive electronic components, including resistors, capacitors, and inductors, do not rely on an external energy source for their operation. Instead, they serve to modify signals: for instance, a resistor can reduce the amplitude of a signal, while a capacitor can store electrical charge. Passive components are also employed in signal filtering, such as using a capacitor to eliminate high-frequency noise or implementing a low-pass filter.

The primary distinction between active and passive components lies in their energy requirements: active components need a source of energy, whereas passive components do not. This fundamental difference allows active components to amplify and process signals, while passive components focus on modifying and filtering those signals. Understanding the differentiating characteristics of active and passive components is crucial for effective design and troubleshooting in electronic circuits.
