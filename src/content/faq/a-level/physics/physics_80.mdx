Gluons play a crucial role in binding quarks together to form protons, neutrons, and other composite particles.

As the force carriers of the strong nuclear force, gluons are one of the four fundamental forces outlined in the Standard Model of particle physics. The strong force is essential for holding quarks together inside protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. What makes gluons particularly unique among force carriers is that they also possess the ability to carry the force they mediate, allowing them to interact with one another. This characteristic leads to a phenomenon known as confinement, which dictates that quarks cannot exist freely; instead, they are always bound together in groups.

Gluons exist in eight distinct types, often referred to as "colours," which are conceptually similar to the three primary colours of light. Quarks, too, are categorized into three "colours." The strong force between quarks is mediated by the exchange of gluons of varying colours. This intricate interaction is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a fundamental component of the Standard Model.

Research into gluons and the strong force remains a dynamic and active field within particle physics. Gaining insights into the behaviour of the strong force is vital for comprehending the structure of matter and the characteristics of atomic nuclei. Additionally, this understanding has significant implications for the study of high-energy cosmic rays and the behaviour of matter in extreme conditions, such as those found in the early universe and within neutron stars.
