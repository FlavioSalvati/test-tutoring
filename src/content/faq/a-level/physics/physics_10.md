The cosmic web represents a vast, large-scale structure composed of interconnected filaments that include galaxies and dark matter.

Cosmologists utilize the cosmic web to investigate the distribution of matter throughout the universe. This intricate web consists of elongated, slender filaments of gas and dark matter, extending across tremendous distances and linking clusters of galaxies. These filaments serve as highways for the movement of matter and energy, fundamentally influencing the development of galaxies and the universe at large.

Additionally, the cosmic web plays a pivotal role in comprehending galaxy formation. The filaments provide gravitational scaffolding that supports the formation and growth of galaxies. As gas and dust accumulate within these filaments, they can collapse under their own gravitational pull, leading to the formation of stars and eventually entire galaxies.

Researching the cosmic web has also illuminated the characteristics of dark matter, which constitutes the majority of the universe's mass. The structure and evolution of the web can only be accounted for by the existence of dark matter, which interacts solely through gravitational forces and neither emits nor absorbs light.

In summary, the cosmic web is an essential framework for cosmologists, facilitating a deeper understanding of the universe's structure and evolution, as well as the enigmatic nature of dark matter.
