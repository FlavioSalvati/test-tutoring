Radioactive materials are disposed of safely using various methods, including burial, storage, and reprocessing. Each method is tailored to the type of waste and its associated risks.

**Burial** involves placing radioactive waste in a secure, deep underground location, effectively isolating it from the environment. This method is primarily employed for low-level waste, which can include contaminated clothing and tools. The waste is first placed in a sturdy container, which is then secured within a concrete vault and surrounded by multiple layers of soil and rock to ensure its containment.

**Storage** refers to the practice of keeping radioactive waste in a secure location until it has decayed to a level that is considered safe. This method is typically used for high-level waste, such as spent nuclear fuel. The waste is stored in specially designed containers that are housed in secure facilities, including nuclear power plants or government-operated repositories, ensuring their safety and security.

**Reprocessing** involves the extraction of valuable materials from radioactive waste, such as plutonium and uranium. This method is particularly relevant for spent nuclear fuel, which still contains significant amounts of reusable material. The reprocessing process entails dissolving the waste in acid, separating the useful materials, and safely disposing of the remaining waste.

In summary, the safe disposal of radioactive materials is a multifaceted process that necessitates meticulous planning and management. It is crucial to ensure that these materials are effectively isolated from the environment to prevent any potential threats to public health and safety.
