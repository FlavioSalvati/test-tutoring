The energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency.

Light exhibits dual characteristics as both a wave and a particle. The particle-like aspect of light is represented by photons, which possess both energy and momentum. The energy of a photon can be expressed by the equation:

$$
E = hf
$$

where $E$ denotes the energy of the photon, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $f$ represents the frequency of the photon.

This direct relationship between energy and frequency is illustrated in the electromagnetic spectrum, which categorizes various types of electromagnetic radiation in order of increasing frequency and energy. At the low-frequency end of the spectrum, we find radio waves, characterized by their low energy. Conversely, at the high-frequency end, we encounter gamma rays, which possess high energy and frequency.

Additionally, the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength, which is defined as the distance between two successive peaks or troughs of a wave. The relationship between energy and wavelength is captured by the equation:

$$
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
$$

where $c$ represents the speed of light and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon. This equation reveals that photons with shorter wavelengths (corresponding to higher frequencies) carry more energy than those with longer wavelengths (associated with lower frequencies).

In summary, the energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency and inversely proportional to its wavelength. This fundamental relationship is encapsulated in the equations $E = hf$ and $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$, and it is clearly demonstrated in the electromagnetic spectrum.
