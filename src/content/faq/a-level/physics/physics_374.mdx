A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) operates by regulating the flow of electrical current within a semiconductor material.

The structure of a BJT consists of three distinct regions: the emitter, base, and collector. These regions are intentionally doped with various impurities to create either an excess or a deficiency of charge carriers (electrons). The emitter region is heavily doped, resulting in a high concentration of free electrons. In contrast, the base region is lightly doped, leading to a significantly lower concentration of free electrons. The collector region is doped to a moderate level, providing a balanced number of free electrons.

When a voltage is applied to the base terminal, it generates an electric field that draws electrons from the emitter into the base. This movement of electrons facilitates a current flow from the emitter to the collector, which is directly influenced by the voltage applied to the base. As the base voltage increases, the current flowing from the emitter to the collector also rises proportionally.

BJTs are widely utilized in electronic circuits as both amplifiers and switches. In their role as amplifiers, BJTs enhance the input signal by controlling the current flow through the transistor. As switches, they can either permit or obstruct the current flow through the transistor, depending on the voltage applied to the base.
