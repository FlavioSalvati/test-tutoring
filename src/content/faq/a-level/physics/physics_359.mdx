Energy is stored within a nucleus via the binding energy of its constituent particles.

The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons, which are held together by the strong nuclear force. This force is significantly stronger than the electromagnetic force, which causes like charges to repel one another. The strong nuclear force effectively overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between protons, allowing them to be tightly packed within the nucleus.

The binding energy of a nucleus represents the energy required to separate it into its individual particles. This energy is released during the formation of the nucleus and is directly related to the mass defect of the nucleus. Specifically, the mass of a nucleus is less than the total mass of its constituent particles due to the conversion of mass into energy during its formation.

The binding energy per nucleon serves as an indicator of a nucleus's stability. Nuclei with a high binding energy per nucleon are more stable than those with a lower binding energy per nucleon. For instance, iron-56 is recognized as the most stable nucleus because it possesses the highest binding energy per nucleon of all known nuclei.

Nuclear reactions involve the conversion of mass into energy or vice versa. In nuclear fission, a heavy nucleus splits into two lighter nuclei, releasing energy in the process. Conversely, in nuclear fusion, two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, also releasing energy. Both of these processes involve changes in the binding energy of the nuclei involved.
