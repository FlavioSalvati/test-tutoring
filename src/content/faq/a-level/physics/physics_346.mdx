The back electromotive force (back EMF) in an electric motor is fundamentally linked to electromagnetic induction as described by Faraday's Law.

When an electric motor operates, it generates a magnetic field that interacts with the magnetic field produced by the stator. This interaction creates a force that causes the rotor to rotate. As the rotor turns, it cuts through the magnetic field lines of the stator, thereby inducing a voltage within the rotor windings. This induced voltage is referred to as the back EMF.

According to Faraday's Law, a changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a conductor. In the context of an electric motor, the changing magnetic field arises from the rotation of the rotor, which disrupts the magnetic field lines of the stator.

The back EMF plays a crucial role in the functioning of electric motors, as it opposes the applied voltage and consequently limits the current flowing through the motor. This opposition is vital for preventing overheating and potential burnout of the motor. Furthermore, the back EMF can be utilized to measure the motor's speed, since the magnitude of the back EMF is directly proportional to the rotor's rotational speed.

In summary, the back EMF in an electric motor is a direct consequence of electromagnetic induction, a core principle of electromagnetism. Comprehending this relationship is essential for understanding the operation and efficiency of electric motors.
