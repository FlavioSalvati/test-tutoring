The half-life is defined as the time required for half of the radioactive nuclei in a given sample to undergo decay.

Radioactive decay is a stochastic process that occurs in unstable atomic nuclei. The half-life of a radioactive substance specifically refers to the time it takes for half of the original quantity of radioactive nuclei to decay. This half-life is a characteristic property of the substance and remains constant, regardless of the initial number of nuclei present.

The half-life can be utilized to predict the remaining quantity of a radioactive substance after a certain time period. For instance, if the half-life of a substance is one hour, then after two hours, only one-quarter of the original amount will be left.

The concept of half-life is significant across various scientific fields, including medicine, geology, and archaeology. In medicine, the half-life of a drug informs decisions regarding dosage and frequency of administration. In geology, the half-lives of radioactive isotopes assist in dating rocks and minerals. In archaeology, the half-life of carbon-14 is employed to estimate the age of organic materials.

In summary, a solid understanding of the half-life concept is crucial for comprehending the behavior of radioactive substances and their practical applications across multiple disciplines.
