Ultrasound plays a crucial role in ophthalmology for the diagnosis and monitoring of various eye conditions, including retinal detachment.

This non-invasive imaging technique utilizes high-frequency sound waves to generate detailed images of the eye. In the field of ophthalmology, ultrasound is primarily employed to assess conditions that impact the posterior segment of the eye, such as retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and intraocular tumors.

One common method of ultrasound used in ophthalmology is B-scan ultrasound. This technique involves placing a small probe either on the eyelid or directly on the eye's surface. The probe emits sound waves that reflect off the internal structures of the eye. These reflected sound waves are then processed to create a two-dimensional image, which is instrumental in identifying any abnormalities.

Another technique utilized is A-scan ultrasound. This method is specifically designed to measure the length of the eye, a critical factor in determining the appropriate power of an intraocular lens implant during cataract surgery.

Ultrasound is recognized as a safe and effective diagnostic tool for various eye conditions. However, it is important to highlight that ultrasound is not suitable for imaging the anterior segment of the eye, which includes structures such as the cornea and iris. In such instances, alternative imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or slit-lamp biomicroscopy, may be employed.
