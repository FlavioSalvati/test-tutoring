An electric field is a region surrounding a charged object where a force is exerted on other charged objects.

Electric fields are generated by charged particles, such as electrons and protons. The strength of an electric field is quantified in volts per meter ($\text{V/m}$) and is influenced by both the magnitude and direction of the charge that creates the field. The direction of the electric field is defined as the path a positive test charge would take if placed within the field.

Electric fields can be visually represented using field lines. These lines illustrate both the direction and strength of the electric field at various points in space. Field lines always emanate from positive charges and converge towards negative charges. The density of these lines indicates the strength of the field; a greater density of lines corresponds to a stronger electric field.

The properties of electric fields have significant applications across various domains of physics, including electronics, electromagnetism, and particle physics. A thorough understanding of electric fields is crucial for comprehending how charged particles interact with each other and with external forces.
