The time constant of an RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit is defined as the product of the resistance and the capacitance. This parameter is crucial for understanding the rate at which the capacitor charges or discharges.

In an RC circuit, a capacitor is either charged or discharged through a resistor. The time constant, typically denoted by the symbol $\tau$, represents the time required for the capacitor to charge to approximately $63.2\%$ of its maximum charge or to discharge to about $36.8\%$ of its initial charge. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
\tau = R \times C
$$

where $R$ is the resistance in ohms and $C$ is the capacitance in farads.

The time constant plays a significant role in determining the behavior of the circuit. A larger time constant indicates that the capacitor will take more time to charge or discharge, leading to a slower rate of change in voltage across the capacitor. Conversely, a smaller time constant means that the capacitor charges or discharges more rapidly, resulting in a faster rate of voltage change.

Furthermore, the time constant also influences the frequency response of the circuit. A circuit with a small time constant behaves like a high-pass filter, allowing high-frequency signals to pass through more easily. In contrast, a circuit with a large time constant acts as a low-pass filter, permitting low-frequency signals to pass while attenuating higher frequencies.

In summary, the time constant of an RC circuit is a fundamental parameter that dictates both the rate of charge and discharge of the capacitor, as well as the circuit's frequency response characteristics. It is calculated as the product of the resistance and capacitance values:

$$
\tau = R \times C
$$
