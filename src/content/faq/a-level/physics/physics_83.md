The equation of motion for a resonating system can be expressed as 

$$
x(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi),
$$ 

where $x(t)$ denotes the displacement of the object from its equilibrium position, $A$ represents the amplitude of the oscillation, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $t$ is time, and $\phi$ is the phase angle.

In a resonating system, the object oscillates back and forth at a certain frequency. The angular frequency, $\omega$, is intricately linked to the natural frequency of the system. The natural frequency is defined as the frequency at which the system would oscillate if there were no external forces acting upon it. This natural frequency can be calculated using the formula 

$$
f = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}},
$$ 

where $L$ is the inductance and $C$ is the capacitance of the system.

The amplitude $A$ of the oscillation is influenced by the system's initial conditions. If the system starts from a position that is displaced from its equilibrium, the amplitude will typically be larger compared to when the system begins at rest.

The phase angle $\phi$ indicates the position of the object within its oscillation cycle at any given moment in time. This angle is determined by the initial conditions of the system and the frequency of the oscillation.

In summary, the equation of motion for a resonating system is given by 

$$
x(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi),
$$ 

where $x$ is the displacement, $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $t$ is time, and $\phi$ is the phase angle. Additionally, the natural frequency of the system can be computed using the formula 

$$
f = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}}. 
$$
