Quarks are confined within hadrons by the strong nuclear force, which is mediated by gluons.

The strong nuclear force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature and plays a crucial role in holding the nucleus of an atom together. Additionally, it is responsible for binding quarks within hadrons. This force is transmitted through particles known as gluons, which are exchanged between quarks.

A distinctive characteristic of the strong force is that it intensifies as the distance between two quarks increases. Consequently, when quarks are pulled apart, the force between them grows stronger until it becomes sufficient to produce new quarks. These new quarks can then combine with the original quarks to form additional hadrons, a phenomenon known as hadronization.

The confinement of quarks within hadrons is a fundamental aspect of the strong force, although the precise mechanisms behind it remain incompletely understood. It is generally accepted that this confinement is linked to the property of the strong force that causes the interaction between quarks to increase with distance, making it impossible to isolate quarks completely. This phenomenon is referred to as confinement.

In summary, quarks are held within hadrons by the strong nuclear force, mediated by gluons. This force grows stronger with increasing distance between quarks, leading to hadronization and the confinement of quarks within hadrons. Although the exact nature of confinement is not yet fully elucidated, it is thought to be connected to the unique properties of the strong force.
