The phase difference in simple harmonic motion refers to the positional difference between two oscillating objects.

In the context of simple harmonic motion, two objects oscillate at the same frequency but may initiate their motion from different starting points. The phase difference represents the variation in position between these two objects at any specific moment in time. This difference is typically measured in radians or degrees and can take on positive, negative, or zero values.

The phase difference plays a crucial role in determining the interference pattern of waves. When two waves of identical frequency and amplitude interact, they can either amplify each other (known as constructive interference) or diminish one another (referred to as destructive interference). The specific phase difference between the waves dictates the nature of this interference, influencing whether the waves will combine constructively or destructively.

Additionally, the phase difference can be utilized to compute the time delay between two oscillating objects. If the phase difference, denoted as $\Delta \phi$, is known, the time delay, represented by $t$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
t = \frac{\Delta \phi}{2\pi} \times \frac{1}{f}
$$

Here, $f$ represents the frequency of oscillation.

In summary, the phase difference in simple harmonic motion indicates the positional variance between two oscillating objects. It significantly affects interference patterns and can be employed to calculate time delays.
