The magnetic field within a long straight wire can be determined using the Biot-Savart Law.

To find the magnetic field inside a long straight wire, we apply the Biot-Savart Law, which states that the magnetic field at a specific point in space due to a current-carrying conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through the conductor and the length of the conductor, while being inversely proportional to the distance from that point to the conductor.

Mathematically, the Biot-Savart Law is expressed as:

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}
$$

where:
- $B$ represents the magnetic field at the specified point,
- $I$ is the current in the wire,
- $r$ is the distance from the point to the wire, and
- $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.

When calculating the magnetic field within a long straight wire, we assume that the wire is infinitely long and possesses a uniform current density. Under these conditions, the magnetic field remains constant, with a magnitude given by:

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}
$$

It is crucial to recognize that the direction of the magnetic field inside the wire can be determined using the right-hand rule. If you grasp the wire with your right hand, ensuring that your thumb points in the direction of the current, the curl of your fingers will indicate the direction of the magnetic field.

In summary, the Biot-Savart Law serves as a valuable tool for calculating the magnetic field within a long straight wire, which is a fundamental concept in the study of electromagnetism.
