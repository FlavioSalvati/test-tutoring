To calculate the work done against friction, it is essential to know both the frictional force and the distance traveled by the object.

When an object moves along a surface, it encounters a force known as friction. This frictional force opposes the motion of the object, causing it to decelerate. The work done against friction represents the energy required to overcome this resistance and to move the object over a specified distance.

To determine the work done against friction, you first need to calculate the frictional force using the equation:

$$
F_f = \mu N
$$

In this equation, $ F_f $ denotes the force of friction, $ \mu $ is the coefficient of friction, and $ N $ is the normal force. The normal force is the perpendicular force exerted by the surface on the object.

Once you have computed the frictional force, you can find the work done against friction using the equation:

$$
W = F_f d
$$

Here, $ W $ represents the work done, $ F_f $ is the force of friction, and $ d $ is the distance traveled. If the frictional force remains constant, you can simply multiply the force by the distance to obtain the total work done.

It is also important to note that the work done against friction is always negative. This is due to the fact that the frictional force acts in the opposite direction to the object's displacement, leading to a negative value for work when calculated in this context.
