The weak nuclear force is responsible for beta decay, a process in which a neutron is transformed into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino.

Beta decay is a specific type of radioactive decay that occurs within the nucleus of an atom when a neutron converts into a proton, along with the emission of an electron and an antineutrino. This transformation is mediated by the weak nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The weak nuclear force plays a crucial role in the decay of subatomic particles, such as neutrons and protons, and is unique in its ability to change the flavor of quarks.

In the beta decay process, a neutron within the atomic nucleus is converted into a proton. This transformation is facilitated by the emission of a $W^-$ boson, which subsequently decays into an electron and an antineutrino. These emitted particles are released from the nucleus.

Although the weak nuclear force is significantly weaker than both the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces, it is this relative weakness that makes beta decay a slower process. Nevertheless, beta decay is essential in nuclear physics because it enables unstable nuclei to transition into more stable configurations. This process has important applications in various fields, including nuclear energy and medicine, where radioactive isotopes are utilized for imaging and therapeutic purposes.
