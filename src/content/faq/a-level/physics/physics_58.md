The lens plays a crucial role in determining the magnification of an optical instrument by bending light rays.

The magnification of such an instrument is primarily influenced by the focal length of the lens. Specifically, a lens with a shorter focal length produces a greater magnification compared to a lens with a longer focal length. This occurs because a lens with a shorter focal length bends light rays more sharply, resulting in a larger image.

Moreover, the magnification is also affected by the distance between the lens and the object being observed. When the object is positioned closer to the lens, the magnification increases. This enhancement occurs because the light rays are bent more significantly as they traverse the lens, leading to a larger image.

It is important to note that the magnification of an optical instrument is not solely dictated by the lens. The eyepiece of the instrument also contributes significantly to the overall magnification. The eyepiece functions like a magnifying glass, further enlarging the image produced by the lens. The magnification provided by the eyepiece depends on its focal length; a shorter focal length eyepiece yields a larger magnification.

In conclusion, while the lens impacts the magnification of an optical instrument through the bending of light rays, factors such as the distance between the lens and the object, as well as the focal length of the eyepiece, also play vital roles in determining the final magnification.
