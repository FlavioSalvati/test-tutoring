Mechanical resonance refers to the vibration of physical objects, while electrical resonance pertains to the oscillation of electrical circuits.

Mechanical resonance occurs when a physical object vibrates at its natural frequency, which is determined by its intrinsic properties such as mass and stiffness. When an external force is applied at this natural frequency, the object will vibrate with an increased amplitude, which can lead to potential damage or structural failure. Notable examples of mechanical resonance include the catastrophic collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge and the shattering of a wine glass when a vocalist hits a high note.

On the other hand, electrical resonance takes place when an electrical circuit oscillates at its natural frequency, which is defined by the circuit's inductance, capacitance, and resistance. When an alternating current is applied at this frequency, the circuit will resonate, resulting in amplified voltage and current. This phenomenon is particularly beneficial in applications such as radio broadcasting and electric guitars, where resonance is utilized to enhance signal strength.

Although both mechanical and electrical resonance involve the amplification of frequency, they differ significantly in their physical nature and the types of systems to which they apply. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for the design and maintenance of safe and efficient mechanical and electrical systems.
