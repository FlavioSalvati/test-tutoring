The expansion of the universe causes distant galaxies to appear to be receding from us.

As the universe expands, the space between galaxies also increases. Consequently, the light emitted by these distant galaxies must traverse a greater distance to reach us. This results in the light being stretched and shifted towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum, a phenomenon referred to as redshift. Redshift serves as a crucial indicator of the universe's expansion: the greater the distance to a galaxy, the more pronounced the redshift.

Redshift can be utilized to calculate both the distance of a galaxy and its velocity relative to us. This data is instrumental in mapping the distribution of galaxies throughout the universe and in studying its large-scale structure.

However, redshift also implies that the light from distant galaxies is less intense than it would be if the universe were not expanding. This dimming occurs because the light is distributed over a larger area as it travels through space, making it challenging to observe and analyze distant galaxies, particularly those located at the edge of the observable universe.

Despite these observational difficulties, studies of distant galaxies have yielded valuable insights into the early universe and the processes that have contributed to its evolution. The expansion of the universe remains a fundamental focus of research in astronomy and astrophysics.
