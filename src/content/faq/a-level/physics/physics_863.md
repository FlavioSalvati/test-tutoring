The nucleus of an atom primarily consists of two types of subatomic particles: protons and neutrons.

Protons are positively charged particles located within the nucleus, and they play a crucial role in defining the atomic number of an element. The atomic number not only identifies the element but also influences its chemical properties. In contrast, neutrons are neutral particles that also reside in the nucleus. They serve to stabilize the nucleus by counteracting the repulsive forces between the positively charged protons.

The identity of an element is determined by the number of protons present in its nucleus. For instance, every carbon atom contains exactly six protons. The number of neutrons can vary among atoms of the same element, leading to the existence of different isotopes. Isotopes share the same number of protons but differ in their neutron count.

The overall mass of an atom is primarily dependent on the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. While electrons, which are negatively charged particles, orbit the nucleus, they contribute negligibly to the atom's mass.

In summary, the nucleus of an atom is composed of protons and neutrons, which collectively determine both the identity and mass of the element. Electrons, while present, have a minimal impact on the overall mass of the atom.
