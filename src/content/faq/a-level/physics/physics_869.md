We determine the distance to nearby stars using the technique known as parallax.

Parallax refers to the apparent shift in the position of an object when viewed from different angles. To measure the parallax of a star, astronomers observe its position in the sky from two distinct points in Earth's orbit, which are spaced six months apart. By measuring the angle between these two observations, astronomers can calculate the distance to the star using trigonometric principles.

However, the parallax method is only effective for stars located within a certain range. As the distance to a star increases, the parallax angle diminishes, making it increasingly challenging to measure accurately. Consequently, this method is reliable primarily for stars that are within a few hundred light-years from Earth.

For stars that lie beyond this range, alternative methods are employed, such as the distance modulus method. This approach utilizes the star's apparent brightness alongside its known absolute brightness to determine its distance. However, the distance modulus method relies on assumptions about the star's luminosity, which can lead to less accurate results compared to the parallax method.

In summary, determining the distances to nearby stars is essential for understanding the structure and evolution of our galaxy. The parallax method remains the most reliable and precise technique for measuring distances to nearby stars.
