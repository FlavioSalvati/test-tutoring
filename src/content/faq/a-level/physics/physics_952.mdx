The mass of a black hole is inferred from observations of its gravitational influence on nearby matter.

Black holes are objects with gravitational fields so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape their grasp, making them impossible to observe directly. Instead, scientists focus on the effects of a black hole's gravity on surrounding matter, such as stars and gas clouds.

One common method for estimating a black hole's mass involves observing the orbits of stars in its vicinity. By carefully analyzing the orbital paths of these stars, scientists can calculate the mass of the black hole they are orbiting.

Another approach is to study the accretion disk, which is a rotating disk of gas and dust that surrounds the black hole. As matter spirals inward and falls into the black hole, it becomes heated and emits radiation. Telescopes can detect this radiation, and by examining its characteristics, researchers can estimate the mass of the black hole.

Additionally, gravitational waves provide another means of measuring a black hole's mass. When two black holes merge, they generate ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves. By analyzing the properties of these waves, scientists can determine the masses of the merging black holes.

In summary, the mass of a black hole is measured indirectly through its gravitational effects on surrounding matter, utilizing various methodologies including the study of star orbits, accretion disks, and gravitational waves.
