The activity of a radioactive substance is quantified using a Geiger-Muller tube in conjunction with a counter.

Radioactivity refers to the process wherein unstable atomic nuclei release particles or electromagnetic radiation. The activity of a radioactive substance denotes the rate at which it emits this radiation. This emission can be effectively measured using a Geiger-Muller tube and a counter.

A Geiger-Muller tube is an instrument designed to detect ionizing radiation. It consists of a gas-filled chamber with electrodes located at each end. When radiation enters the chamber, it ionizes the gas, leading to the generation of a current that can be detected by the electrodes. The counter is utilized to measure the frequency of the current produced.

To determine the activity of a radioactive substance, the substance is positioned near the Geiger-Muller tube. The tube detects the radiation emitted by the substance and generates a current. The counter then measures the rate at which this current is produced, which is directly proportional to the activity of the substance.

The activity of a radioactive substance is expressed in becquerels (Bq), which represent the number of radioactive decays occurring per second. Specifically, one becquerel is defined as one decay per second, or $1 \, \text{Bq} = 1 \, \text{decay/s}$. Additionally, the activity can be measured in curies (Ci), an older unit of measurement. Notably, one curie is equivalent to $3.7 \times 10^{10}$ becquerels, or $1 \, \text{Ci} = 3.7 \times 10^{10} \, \text{Bq}$.

In summary, the activity of a radioactive substance is quantifiably assessed through the use of a Geiger-Muller tube and a counter. The rate at which the tube generates a current correlates with the substance's activity, which can be measured in either becquerels or curies.
