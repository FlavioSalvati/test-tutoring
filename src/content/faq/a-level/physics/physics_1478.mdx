Radiation can induce mutations by damaging DNA molecules, which leads to errors during replication and repair processes.

When high-energy radiation, such as X-rays or gamma rays, interacts with DNA, it can disrupt the chemical bonds that maintain the structural integrity of the molecule. This disruption can result in various types of damage, including single-strand breaks, double-strand breaks, and the formation of abnormal chemical bonds between adjacent nucleotides.

If this damage is not repaired accurately, it can lead to mistakes in DNA replication or transcription. For instance, a single-strand break may cause a replication fork to stall, resulting in incorrect copying of the DNA sequence. On the other hand, a double-strand break may be repaired through a process known as non-homologous end joining, which can inadvertently introduce errors or deletions in the DNA sequence.

In some instances, the damage inflicted on the DNA may be so extensive that the cell cannot repair it, prompting the cell to undergo programmed cell death, a process known as apoptosis. However, if the damage is not severe enough to trigger apoptosis, the cell may continue to divide, thereby passing the mutations on to its daughter cells.

The likelihood of radiation-induced mutations is influenced by several factors, including the dose and type of radiation, as well as the sensitivity of the organism or tissue to radiation damage. Consequently, it is crucial to minimize exposure to radiation and implement protective measures, such as shielding and dosimetry, to mitigate the risk of mutations and other detrimental effects.
