Diffraction occurs at a single slit when light waves pass through and spread out.

When a beam of light travels through a narrow slit, it undergoes diffraction, resulting in a pattern of alternating bright and dark fringes on a screen positioned behind the slit. This phenomenon arises from the wave nature of light, as the light waves interfere with one another as they pass through the slit.

The degree of diffraction is influenced by both the width of the slit and the wavelength of the light. Specifically, a narrower slit produces greater diffraction, while a wider slit results in less diffraction. Additionally, longer wavelengths of light exhibit more diffraction than shorter wavelengths.

The diffraction pattern generated by a single slit can be mathematically described using the intensity formula, which considers both the angle of diffraction and the distance from the slit to the screen. The central maximum, which is the brightest point in the pattern, is flanked by alternating bright and dark fringes.

Single slit diffraction is a significant phenomenon in physics with various practical applications, including the design of optical instruments such as telescopes and microscopes. A solid understanding of the principles of diffraction is essential for advancing these technologies.
