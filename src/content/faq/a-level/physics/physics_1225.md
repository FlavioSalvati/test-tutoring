Functional MRI (fMRI) is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique that measures changes in blood flow to visualize brain activity.

fMRI operates by utilizing magnetic fields and radio waves to detect variations in blood flow within the brain. When a specific region of the brain becomes active, it requires an increased supply of oxygen and glucose, leading to a corresponding rise in blood flow to that area. This increase in blood flow can be captured by fMRI, enabling researchers to identify which parts of the brain are engaged during various tasks.

During an fMRI scan, the patient reclines inside a large cylindrical machine known as a scanner. The scanner generates a strong magnetic field and emits radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain. Throughout the scanning process, the patient may be asked to engage in different activities, such as viewing images or solving puzzles, to stimulate various brain regions.

The fMRI scanner detects alterations in blood flow by measuring the levels of oxygen in the blood. Oxygen-rich blood exhibits different magnetic properties compared to oxygen-poor blood, allowing the scanner to differentiate between the two. By analyzing the distribution of oxygen-rich blood across different brain areas, fMRI can generate a functional map of brain activity.

fMRI has numerous applications in the fields of neuroscience and psychology, including the investigation of brain function in both healthy individuals and those with neurological disorders. However, it is essential to recognize that fMRI measures changes in blood flow rather than direct neural activity. Consequently, it is often employed alongside other techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG), to provide a more comprehensive understanding of brain function.
