Power in an alternating current (AC) circuit that includes reactance is determined using the formula:

$$ P = VI \cos \phi $$

In an AC circuit with reactance, the voltage and current are not synchronized, which results in a phase difference. Consequently, the power cannot simply be calculated as the product of current and voltage, as it would be in a purely resistive circuit. Instead, the power is given by the formula above, where:

- $V$ represents the root mean square (RMS) voltage,
- $I$ denotes the RMS current, and
- $\cos \phi$ is the power factor.

The power factor quantifies the efficiency of the circuit by indicating the proportion of total power that performs useful work versus the amount lost as heat. In a purely resistive circuit, the power factor equals $1$, since the current and voltage are in phase, meaning all power is effectively utilized for work. However, in circuits containing reactance, the power factor is less than $1$, reflecting the energy lost due to the phase difference between current and voltage.

To ascertain the power factor, one must first measure the phase angle between the current and voltage, which can be accomplished using a phase angle meter or an oscilloscope. The power factor can then be calculated using the formula:

$$ \cos \phi = \frac{P}{VI} $$

In this equation, $P$ represents the power in watts, $V$ is the RMS voltage in volts, and $I$ is the RMS current in amperes.
