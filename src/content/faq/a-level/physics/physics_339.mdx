Fermat's principle of least time, also referred to as the principle of least time or the principle of least action, is a foundational concept in optics. It posits that light travels between two points in the shortest possible time.

This principle is predicated on the assumption that light moves in straight lines and chooses the path that minimizes the time taken to traverse between two points. 

Fermat's principle of least time provides a framework for understanding the laws of reflection and refraction. For instance, when light reflects off a smooth surface, it follows a trajectory that requires the least time to reach the observer from the source. This trajectory corresponds to the condition where the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.

In a similar vein, when light transitions through a medium with a different refractive index, it adheres to the path that minimizes travel time between the source and the observer. This trajectory is characterized by the relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction, which is described by Snell's law.

Moreover, the principle of least time is instrumental in the study of light's behavior through lenses and other optical devices. By leveraging this principle, scientists and engineers can design optical systems that achieve specific outcomes, such as magnification or image formation.

In summary, Fermat's principle of least time is a crucial tenet of optics, asserting that light travels between two points in the shortest possible time. This principle elucidates the laws of reflection and refraction and serves as a guiding framework in the design of optical systems.
