The objective lens plays a crucial role in collecting and magnifying the image of a specimen, while the eyepiece further enhances and focuses this image for the observer.

In a compound microscope, the objective lens is positioned close to the specimen and is designed with a short focal length. This configuration enables it to produce a highly magnified and detailed image. The objective lens consists of multiple optical elements that work in concert to ensure a clear and sharp representation of the specimen.

Conversely, the eyepiece is situated near the observer's eye and serves to further magnify and refine the image generated by the objective lens. Like the objective lens, the eyepiece is also composed of several lenses that collaborate to enhance image clarity. Notably, the eyepiece has a longer focal length compared to the objective lens, allowing it to achieve an even greater level of magnification.

The synergy between the objective lens and the eyepiece results in a significantly magnified image of the specimen, which is observable by the viewer. The overall magnification achieved is determined by the ratio of the focal lengths of the objective lens and the eyepiece. As the magnification increases, so does the resolution, enabling the observer to discern finer details of the specimen.

In summary, the fundamental function of the objective lens and eyepiece in a compound microscope is to collect, magnify, and focus the image of the specimen, ultimately producing a highly magnified view that can be readily examined by the observer.
