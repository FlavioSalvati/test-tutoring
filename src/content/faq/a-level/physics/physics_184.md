Thermal equilibrium refers to a state in which two objects share the same temperature, resulting in no net heat transfer between them.

Thermal equilibrium occurs when two objects are in direct contact and reach the same temperature. At this stage, there is no net flow of heat energy between the objects; they are considered to be in thermal equilibrium. Heat energy naturally flows from hotter objects to cooler ones until they attain thermal equilibrium. This principle is encapsulated in the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics.

The process of reaching thermal equilibrium can be observed in various everyday scenarios. For example, when a hot cup of coffee is placed on a table, heat energy transfers from the coffee to the table until both reach the same temperature. Similarly, when a person enters a cold room, their body heat dissipates into the environment until thermal equilibrium is achieved with the room.

Understanding thermal equilibrium is crucial in several fields of physics, including thermodynamics and heat transfer. It is also a fundamental concept in the design of heating and cooling systems, as well as in evaluating energy efficiency.

In conclusion, thermal equilibrium is defined as a state where two objects have the same temperature, resulting in no heat flow between them. This condition is reached through direct contact and is a vital concept across various domains of physics.
