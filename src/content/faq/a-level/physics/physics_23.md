A mechanical wave is defined as a disturbance that travels through a medium, transferring energy without the transport of matter.

Mechanical waves can be categorized into two primary types: transverse waves and longitudinal waves. In a transverse wave, the particles of the medium oscillate in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Common examples of transverse waves include waves on a string, water waves, and electromagnetic waves. Conversely, in a longitudinal wave, the particles of the medium oscillate parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Sound waves and seismic waves are typical examples of longitudinal waves.

It is important to note that mechanical waves necessitate a medium for their propagation. This medium can exist in various states, including solid, liquid, or gas. The speed at which a mechanical wave travels is influenced by the properties of the medium, such as its density, elasticity, and temperature. Generally, mechanical waves move faster in media that are denser and more elastic.

Mechanical waves exhibit several phenomena, including reflection, refraction, and diffraction. When a wave encounters a boundary between two different media, it can undergo reflection (bouncing back), refraction (bending), or diffraction (spreading out). These phenomena are crucial in numerous applications, including sonar, ultrasound, and seismic imaging.

In summary, a mechanical wave is a type of wave that requires a medium for propagation and is capable of transferring energy without moving matter. Mechanical waves can be classified as either transverse or longitudinal, and they demonstrate various behaviors such as reflection, refraction, and diffraction. A thorough understanding of mechanical waves is essential for various fields within physics and engineering.
