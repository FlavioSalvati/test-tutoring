To calculate the power of a motor, you need to multiply the torque by the angular velocity.

Power, in the context of a motor, is defined as the rate at which work is accomplished or energy is transferred. It is typically measured in watts (W) or horsepower (hp). The power output of a motor can be determined using the relationship between torque and angular velocity. Torque, which is the force responsible for rotation, is measured in newton-metres (Nm), while angular velocity, representing the rate of rotation, is measured in radians per second (rad/s).

The mathematical formula for calculating power is given by:

$$
P = \tau \omega
$$

where $ P $ represents power, $ \tau $ denotes torque, and $ \omega $ signifies angular velocity. If the torque is expressed in pound-feet (lb-ft), it needs to be converted to newton-metres by multiplying by approximately $1.3558$. Similarly, if the angular velocity is provided in revolutions per minute (rpm), it should be converted to radians per second via multiplication by approximately $0.1047$.

It's crucial to recognize that the power output of a motor is not a constant value; it varies with the load applied to the motor. The maximum power output is typically achieved at the point of maximum efficiency, which generally occurs around $75\%$ of the motor's maximum speed. For a more comprehensive understanding of how power interacts within various physical systems, you may wish to explore related concepts in physics.
