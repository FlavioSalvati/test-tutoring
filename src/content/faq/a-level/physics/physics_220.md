Electron capture is a type of radioactive decay that occurs when a nucleus captures an electron from its inner shell, typically from the K-shell. This process results in the transformation of a proton into a neutron, accompanied by the emission of a neutrino. The emitted neutrino carries away energy and momentum, leading to a nucleus that has one fewer proton and one additional neutron compared to the original nucleus.

This phenomenon can take place in any nucleus where the proton-to-neutron ratio is excessively high. Electron capture is particularly prevalent in large, unstable nuclei, such as those found in radioactive isotopes. In these cases, the strong nuclear force is insufficient to counteract the electromagnetic repulsion among protons, resulting in an unstable nucleus. By capturing an electron, the nucleus can decrease its proton-to-neutron ratio, thereby enhancing its stability.

Electron capture plays a crucial role in nuclear physics and has several practical applications. For instance, it is employed in medical imaging to generate positron-emitting isotopes, which can be detected using a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. Additionally, electron capture is utilized in nuclear power plants to manage the rate of nuclear reactions and to produce isotopes for both medical and industrial purposes.
