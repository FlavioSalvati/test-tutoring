The SI unit of electric charge is the coulomb, denoted as $C$.

Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that exists in two forms: positive and negative. The definition of one coulomb is based on the flow of electric current; specifically, it is the amount of electric charge transported by a current of one ampere flowing for one second. In other words, one coulomb is equivalent to approximately $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ elementary charges, which corresponds to the charge of a single proton or a single electron.

The coulomb plays a crucial role in electrical measurements, including the assessment of charge stored in capacitors and the evaluation of current flowing through electrical circuits. It is also integral to the calculations of electric fields and forces, and it is foundational in defining other electrical units such as the volt and the ohm.

In addition to the coulomb, there are other specialized units of electric charge used in specific contexts. For instance, the statcoulomb is utilized in electrostatics and is defined as the charge that would repel an identical charge at a distance of one centimeter with a force of one dyne.

Overall, grasping the concept of the SI unit of electric charge is essential for students studying physics, as it is a fundamental principle that underlies many topics within the discipline.
