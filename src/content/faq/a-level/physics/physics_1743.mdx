The potential energy of a system undergoing simple harmonic motion can be expressed with the equation:

$$ U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 $$

In this context, the potential energy is stored in a spring or elastic material that is either stretched or compressed. The amount of potential energy stored in the system is directly proportional to the displacement from its equilibrium position. This indicates that as the system is displaced further from its equilibrium position, the potential energy stored in the system increases.

In the equation $$ U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 $$:

- $ U $ represents the potential energy,
- $ k $ is the spring constant, and
- $ x $ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

This equation illustrates that the potential energy of the system rises as the displacement from the equilibrium position increases.

To visualize this relationship, consider a graph of potential energy versus displacement. The resulting graph takes the form of a parabolic curve that opens upwards, with the lowest point indicating the equilibrium position. The potential energy reaches its peak when the displacement is at its maximum and is minimized when the displacement is at the equilibrium position.
