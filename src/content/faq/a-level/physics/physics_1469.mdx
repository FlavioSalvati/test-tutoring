The work performed during a cyclic process corresponds to the area enclosed by the cycle on a pressure-volume graph.

In a cyclic process, a system experiences a series of transformations that ultimately return it to its initial state. The work done in this process is represented by the area enclosed by the cycle on a pressure-volume graph. This relationship arises because work is defined as the product of force and displacement. In the context of a gas system, the force is proportional to pressure, while the displacement is proportional to volume.

To determine the work done in a cyclic process, begin by plotting the process on a pressure-volume graph. Next, calculate the area enclosed by the cycle, which can be accomplished through integration. If the cycle is traced in a clockwise direction, the work done will be negative; conversely, if the cycle is traced counterclockwise, the work done will be positive.

It is essential to emphasize that the work done in a cyclic process is independent of the specific path taken by the system. This means that the work remains consistent regardless of whether the process occurs slowly or rapidly, or whether it is reversible or irreversible. For further insights into the fundamental concepts of work in physics, consider exploring its applications in various contexts.
