To determine the total uncertainty of multiple measurements, one must combine the individual uncertainties using the method of adding in quadrature.

Each measurement will possess its own associated uncertainty. To compute the total uncertainty, these individual uncertainties are combined by adding their squares and taking the square root of the result. This process is known as adding in quadrature.

For instance, consider two measurements with uncertainties of $0.5$ and $0.3$. The total uncertainty can be calculated as follows:

$$
\sqrt{(0.5^2) + (0.3^2)} = \sqrt{(0.25) + (0.09)} = \sqrt{0.34} \approx 0.58
$$

Thus, the total uncertainty of the measurements is approximately $0.58$. It is crucial to express uncertainties to one significant figure, which means the final result should be reported as $0.6$.

Additionally, when calculating the total uncertainty, one must pay attention to the units of the measurements. If the measurements are expressed in different units, they must be converted to the same unit before performing the quadrature addition.

In summary, adding uncertainties in quadrature is an effective method for calculating the total uncertainty of multiple measurements. This technique is an essential skill for A-Level Physics students to master.
