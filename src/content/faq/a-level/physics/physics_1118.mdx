Young's modulus is a key indicator of a material's stiffness when subjected to tension or compression.

Also referred to as the modulus of elasticity, Young's modulus quantifies a material's resistance to deformation. It is defined as the ratio of stress (force per unit area) to strain (the relative change in length), expressed mathematically as:

$$
E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}
$$ 

where $E$ represents Young's modulus, $\sigma$ is the stress, and $\epsilon$ is the strain. A higher value of Young's modulus indicates that a material is more resistant to deformation.

This property is crucial for engineers and scientists, as it allows them to predict how materials will behave under various conditions. For instance, materials with a high Young's modulus are often preferred for applications that require significant stiffness, such as in the construction of bridges and buildings.

Several factors can influence Young's modulus, including the type of material, its crystal structure, and the environmental conditions such as temperature and pressure. Generally, metals exhibit a higher Young's modulus compared to polymers, and materials with a more ordered crystal structure tend to have a greater Young's modulus than those with a more disordered arrangement.

In summary, Young's modulus is a fundamental material property that plays a vital role in determining mechanical behavior and suitability for various applications.
