Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) utilize the unique properties of liquid crystals to generate images. 

LCDs are a prevalent type of flat-panel display found in various electronic devices, including televisions, computer monitors, and smartphones. These displays function by manipulating liquid crystals, which are substances that possess characteristics of both liquids and solids.

An LCD comprises two layers of polarizing filters with a layer of liquid crystal material sandwiched between them. When an electric current is applied to the liquid crystal layer, the crystals orient themselves in a specific manner, enabling light to pass through the second polarizing filter, thereby creating an image.

There are two primary types of LCDs: passive matrix and active matrix. Passive matrix displays utilize a grid of electrodes to apply voltage to individual pixels. In contrast, active matrix displays employ thin-film transistors (TFTs) to control each pixel independently. Active matrix displays are more widely used due to their superior image quality and faster response times.

LCDs offer several advantages over other display technologies, including low power consumption, high resolution, and the capacity to present images clearly in bright sunlight. However, they also have some limitations, such as restricted viewing angles and slower refresh rates compared to alternative display technologies.
