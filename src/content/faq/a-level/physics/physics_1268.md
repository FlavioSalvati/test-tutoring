The principle of inertial frames asserts that the laws of physics are consistent across all inertial frames of reference.

Inertial frames are defined as reference frames in which an object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion continues to move with a constant velocity in a straight line. This principle implies that if an experiment is conducted in one inertial frame, the same results will be replicated in any other inertial frame that is moving at a constant velocity relative to the first frame.

Conversely, non-inertial frames are reference frames that are either accelerating or rotating. Within these frames, objects seem to experience fictitious forces that do not exist in inertial frames. For instance, when you are in a car that accelerates, you feel a force pushing you back into your seat. This sensation is not experienced in an inertial frame, hence it is referred to as a fictitious force.

The principle of inertial frames is crucial in physics because it enables us to predict the behavior of objects without needing to account for the motion of the observer. By selecting an inertial frame as our reference point, we can streamline our calculations and make precise predictions regarding the motion of objects.
