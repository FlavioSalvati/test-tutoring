The phase angle plays a significant role in influencing the behavior of capacitive and inductive circuits by modifying the relationship between current and voltage.

In an alternating current (AC) circuit, voltage and current are not always synchronized, meaning they can be out of phase. The phase angle represents the difference in phase between the voltage and current waveforms. In a capacitive circuit, the current leads the voltage by $90^\circ$, which corresponds to a phase angle of $-90^\circ$. Conversely, in an inductive circuit, the current lags behind the voltage by $90^\circ$, resulting in a phase angle of $+90^\circ$.

The phase angle also impacts the impedance of the circuit. In a capacitive circuit, impedance decreases as frequency increases, while in an inductive circuit, impedance increases with frequency. The impedance reaches its minimum value when the phase angle is zero, which occurs at the resonant frequency of the circuit.

Additionally, the phase angle influences the power factor of the circuit. The power factor is defined as the ratio of real power to apparent power. In a purely resistive circuit, the power factor is $1$, indicating perfect efficiency. However, in capacitive or inductive circuits, the power factor is less than $1$ due to the phase angle. Specifically, a capacitive circuit exhibits a leading power factor, whereas an inductive circuit exhibits a lagging power factor.

In summary, the phase angle significantly affects both the impedance and power factor of capacitive and inductive circuits, and it ultimately determines the relationship between the voltage and current waveforms.
