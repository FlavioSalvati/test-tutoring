X-rays play a crucial role in baggage scanning due to their ability to penetrate various materials and produce images of their contents.

X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation characterized by high energy and short wavelengths. As X-rays traverse materials, they may be absorbed or scattered based on the density and composition of the material. This unique property makes X-rays particularly valuable for imaging applications, such as baggage scanning.

In the baggage scanning process, X-ray machines generate a beam of X-rays that passes through the luggage, creating an image on a detector located on the opposite side. The detector captures the X-rays that successfully pass through the baggage and transforms them into an image for analysis by security personnel. This image reveals the contents of the baggage, enabling the identification of prohibited items or potential threats.

It is important to note that X-rays can be harmful to human health if exposure is prolonged or excessive. To mitigate these risks, baggage scanning machines are engineered to emit low doses of X-rays, ensuring that passengers are not directly exposed to the beam. Furthermore, security personnel operating these machines are required to wear protective gear and adhere to established safety protocols.

In summary, X-rays are utilized in baggage scanning due to their ability to penetrate materials and create detailed images of their contents. This technology empowers security personnel to detect potential threats, thereby enhancing the safety of passengers and crew.
