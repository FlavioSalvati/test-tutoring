The concept of phase difference in wave phenomena refers to the variation in the position of two waves at a specific moment in time.

When two waves possess the same frequency and amplitude as they propagate through a medium, their interaction can either lead to reinforcement or cancellation, which depends on their phase difference. If the waves are in phase—meaning their peaks and troughs align perfectly—they will combine constructively, resulting in a wave of greater amplitude. Conversely, if the waves are out of phase—meaning their peaks do not align with the troughs of the other—they will interfere destructively, leading to a reduction in amplitude or potentially creating no wave at all.

Phase difference is quantified in degrees or radians and can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Phase Difference} = \left( \frac{\text{Path Difference}}{\text{Wavelength}} \right) \times 360^\circ
$$

In this formula, the path difference refers to the disparity in the distance traveled by the two waves from their respective sources to a designated point.

Understanding phase difference is essential in various wave phenomena, including interference, diffraction, and the formation of standing waves. It is also pivotal in applications such as sonar and radar systems, where it helps determine the distance between two wave sources.

In summary, the phase difference in wave phenomena signifies the positional discrepancy between two waves at a particular moment. This difference is crucial in ascertaining whether the waves will reinforce or cancel each other, and it can be computed based on the path difference and the wavelength.
