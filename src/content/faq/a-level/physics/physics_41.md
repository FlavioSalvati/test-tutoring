To determine the magnetic field strength at a specific point in space, you can utilize the following formula:

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}
$$

In this equation, \( B \) represents the magnetic field strength, \( \mu_0 \) is the permeability of free space, \( I \) denotes the current flowing through the wire, and \( r \) indicates the distance from the wire to the point in space where you wish to measure the magnetic field strength.

Magnetic field strength is defined as a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude indicates the strength of the magnetic field, while the direction is determined by the orientation of the current flow. Notably, the direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current direction and can be determined using the right-hand rule.

To effectively apply this formula, you need the following information:
1. The current \( I \) flowing through the wire.
2. The distance \( r \) from the wire to the point of interest.
3. The constant \( \mu_0 \), which is approximately equal to \( 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{Tm/A} \).

After gathering these values, you can substitute them into the formula to compute the magnetic field strength at the desired point in space.

In summary, calculating the magnetic field strength at a given location involves using the appropriate formula and knowing the current flowing through the wire, the distance from the wire, and the value of \( \mu_0 \).
