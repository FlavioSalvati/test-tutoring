The elastic potential energy stored in a spring is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position.

When a spring is either stretched or compressed, it accumulates potential energy in the form of elastic potential energy. This energy arises due to the deformation of the spring from its natural, or equilibrium, position. The amount of elastic potential energy ($U$) stored in a spring can be quantitatively described by the formula:

$$
U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

In this equation, $k$ represents the spring constant, which is a measure of the spring's stiffness, and $x$ denotes the displacement from the equilibrium position. This relationship indicates that as the displacement $x$ increases, the elastic potential energy $U$ stored in the spring also increases.

The connection between elastic potential energy and displacement is further illustrated in a graph depicting the spring's potential energy as a function of displacement. This graph takes the shape of a parabolic curve, with the vertex located at the equilibrium position. As the displacement increases, the slope of the curve becomes steeper, signifying a more pronounced increase in potential energy.

In conclusion, the elastic potential energy in a spring is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position. This relationship is captured both mathematically through the equation provided and visually through the corresponding graph of potential energy versus displacement.
