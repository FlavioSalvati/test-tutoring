The strong nuclear force is the fundamental interaction that binds protons and neutrons together within the nucleus of an atom.

It is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, alongside gravity, electromagnetism, and the weak nuclear force. This force plays a crucial role in overcoming the repulsive electromagnetic force that arises between positively charged protons, thereby ensuring the stability of atomic nuclei. Without the strong nuclear force, atomic nuclei would disintegrate, and, consequently, matter as we know it would not exist.

The strong nuclear force is mediated by particles known as gluons, which interact with quarksâ€”the fundamental constituents of protons and neutrons. The interaction between quarks is so powerful that they are permanently bound together, forming composite particles called hadrons. Protons and neutrons, which are the building blocks of atomic nuclei, are examples of hadrons.

One notable characteristic of the strong nuclear force is its very short range; it operates effectively only over distances on the order of $10^{-15}$ meters. This limited range is a result of a phenomenon known as confinement, which causes the force between quarks to diminish rapidly as they move farther apart. Consequently, the strong nuclear force predominantly influences particles within the nucleus, leaving those outside its range unaffected.

In the field of particle physics, researchers investigate the strong nuclear force using particle accelerators. These sophisticated machines collide particles at high energies, allowing scientists to study the resulting products of these collisions. Through these experiments, physicists gain insights into the properties of the strong nuclear force and the gluons that mediate it.
