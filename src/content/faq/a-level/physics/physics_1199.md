A star's color is intricately linked to its temperature: hotter stars appear bluer, while cooler stars exhibit a redder hue.

The color of a star is fundamentally determined by its temperature. As a star's temperature increases, it emits light across a spectrum of wavelengths, with the peak of this emission shifting toward shorter wavelengths. Consequently, hotter stars produce more blue light, whereas cooler stars emit more red light.

This relationship can be quantified using Wien's law, which states that the wavelength of maximum emission from a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$ \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} $$

where $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ is the wavelength of maximum emission, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, and $b$ is Wien's displacement constant. As a star's temperature increases, the peak of its emission spectrum moves toward shorter wavelengths, resulting in a bluer color.

Understanding the correlation between a star's color and temperature is essential for classifying stars into spectral types. This classification system, which ranges from O (the hottest) to M (the coolest), is based on the presence of specific spectral lines within a star's spectrum. Each spectral type corresponds to a particular temperature range. By analyzing a star's spectrum, astronomers can accurately determine its temperature and spectral type, yielding valuable insights into the star's properties and evolutionary history.
