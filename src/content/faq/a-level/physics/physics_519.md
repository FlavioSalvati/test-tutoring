A black hole singularity is defined as a point of infinite density and zero volume located at the very center of a black hole.

Black holes are formed when a massive star collapses under the influence of its own gravity. This collapse creates a region of space where the gravitational pull is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. At the core of a black hole lies the singularityâ€”a point where the known laws of physics cease to function. The singularity is characterized by infinite density and zero volume, meaning that all the mass of the black hole is concentrated in this single point.

Surrounding the singularity is the event horizon, which marks the boundary of the black hole. The event horizon represents the "point of no return," as anything that crosses this threshold is trapped forever. The event horizon is defined by the escape velocity, which is the speed necessary to break free from the gravitational pull of the black hole. Since the escape velocity at the event horizon exceeds the speed of light, nothing can escape from within this boundary.

It is important to note that the singularity remains a theoretical construct that has not been directly observed. Any object that ventures into a black hole is ultimately torn apart by tidal forces before reaching the singularity. However, the influence of the singularity can be inferred indirectly through its gravitational effects on nearby celestial bodies. The investigation of black holes and their singularities is a vibrant field of research within astrophysics and cosmology.
