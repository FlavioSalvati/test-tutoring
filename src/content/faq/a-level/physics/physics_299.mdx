Spontaneous fission is the phenomenon in which a nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei without any external influence.

This process is a form of radioactive decay that occurs when a heavy, unstable nucleus divides into two lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy during the event. Unlike induced fission, which is triggered by bombarding a nucleus with neutrons or other particles, spontaneous fission occurs naturally in certain isotopes. It predominantly takes place in heavy nuclei that possess an excessive number of protons and neutrons, rendering them unstable.

The likelihood of spontaneous fission increases with the size of the nucleus and the number of neutrons it contains. For instance, uranium-238 has a half-life of approximately $4.5 \times 10^9$ years and undergoes spontaneous fission at a rate of about one fission event per day for each kilogram of material. In contrast, lighter nuclei, such as carbon-14, do not experience spontaneous fission and primarily decay through beta decay.

During the process of spontaneous fission, a considerable amount of energy is emitted in the form of gamma rays, neutrons, and various other particles. While this energy can be harnessed for the generation of nuclear power, it also poses significant risks if not managed properly. Additionally, the byproducts of spontaneous fission can be highly radioactive, presenting potential hazards to both human health and the environment.
