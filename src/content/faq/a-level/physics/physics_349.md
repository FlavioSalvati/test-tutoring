Energy conservation plays a crucial role in particle interactions, governed by the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.

When particles interact, they exchange both energy and momentum. Importantly, the total energy and momentum of the entire system must remain constant before and after the interaction. This fundamental concept is encapsulated in the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.

In the context of particle interactions, energy can be transformed from one form to another. For instance, kinetic energy can be converted into potential energy, or it can be transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat or light. Despite these transformations, the total energy of the system remains unchanged.

Similarly, momentum, which is a vector quantity describing the motion of an object, is also conserved during particle interactions. While momentum can be transferred between particles during interactions, the overall momentum of the system remains constant.

In summary, the conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in the study of particle interactions. It enables physicists to understand and predict the behavior of particles in a variety of scenarios, including collisions and decays.
