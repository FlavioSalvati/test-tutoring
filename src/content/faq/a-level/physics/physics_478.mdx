The lifespan of a star is primarily influenced by its mass, composition, and the nuclear fusion reactions occurring within it.

Stars originate from vast clouds of gas and dust known as nebulae. Among the factors affecting a star's lifespan, mass is the most critical. More massive stars are hotter, brighter, and consume their nuclear fuel at a much faster rate. Consequently, these massive stars have significantly shorter lifespans compared to their less massive counterparts.

The composition of a star also impacts its longevity. While stars are predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium, they contain trace amounts of heavier elements. The presence of these heavier elements accelerates the rate at which a star consumes its fuel, thereby shortening its lifespan.

Nuclear fusion reactions are the fundamental processes through which stars generate energy. The specific type of fusion that occurs within a star is determined by its mass and composition. The most prevalent fusion reaction involves the conversion of hydrogen into helium. As a star exhausts its hydrogen supply, it begins to fuse heavier elements, such as helium, carbon, and oxygen. It is important to note that each successive fusion reaction releases less energy than the one preceding it, leading to a gradual decline in the star's energy output over time.

Eventually, a star will deplete its fuel reserves and will be unable to produce sufficient energy to counterbalance the force of gravity. At this point, the star will collapse inward, resulting in the formation of either a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole, contingent upon its initial mass.

In summary, a star's lifespan is governed by its mass, composition, and the nature of its nuclear fusion processes. More massive stars and those with a greater abundance of heavy elements tend to have shorter lifespans. As they exhaust their fuel, these stars ultimately collapse into one of three end states: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole.
