The principle of baryon number conservation asserts that the total number of baryons in a system remains unchanged throughout any particle interaction.

In the realm of particle physics, conserving baryon number is a crucial principle that governs interactions. Baryons are particles composed of three quarks, with protons and neutrons being the most well-known examples. According to the conservation of baryon number, the total count of baryons in a system must be constant before and after a particle interaction. This implies that the quantity of protons and neutrons must remain unchanged.

For instance, consider a proton-proton collision. In the initial state, there are two protons, each assigned a baryon number of $1$. Following the collision, various particles may be produced; however, the overall baryon number must still equal $2$. This can be achieved in several ways, such as producing either two protons or a combination of one proton and one neutron.

The conservation of baryon number is interconnected with the conservation of other fundamental quantities, including electric charge and lepton number. These conservation laws are instrumental in elucidating particle behavior during interactions and are vital for a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles of physics.

In summary, the conservation of baryon number is a significant principle in particle interactions that dictates that the total number of baryons in a system must remain constant. This principle plays a key role in explaining the behavior of particles during interactions and is essential for grasping the foundational laws of physics.
