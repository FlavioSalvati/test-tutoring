A supermassive black hole is defined as a black hole with a mass ranging from millions to billions of solar masses, or in LaTeX notation, between $10^6$ and $10^9$ times the mass of our Sun.

These extraordinary black holes are typically located at the centers of galaxies, including our own Milky Way. They are significantly larger than stellar black holes, which form from the gravitational collapse of a single massive star. The precise mechanisms that lead to the formation of supermassive black holes remain a subject of ongoing research. It is hypothesized that they may arise from the coalescence of smaller black holes or from the collapse of a large gas cloud.

Supermassive black holes possess an immensely strong gravitational pull, which influences the motion of stars and gas in their vicinity. Additionally, they can emit powerful jets of radiation and particles, which are detectable by astronomers. Investigating supermassive black holes is crucial for enhancing our understanding of galaxy evolution and the universe as a whole.

One of the most well-known supermassive black holes is Sagittarius A*, situated at the center of the Milky Way. It has an estimated mass of approximately $4 \times 10^6$ solar masses and is encircled by a disk of gas and dust. Observations of Sagittarius A* have provided compelling evidence for the existence of black holes and have significantly advanced our understanding of their characteristics and behaviors.
