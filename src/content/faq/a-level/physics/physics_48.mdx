To calculate the percentage error of a measurement, you can follow a straightforward formula.

First, determine the absolute error of the measurement. The absolute error is defined as the difference between the measured value and the true value. For instance, if you measure the length of a rod to be $10 \, \text{cm}$, while the true length is $9.8 \, \text{cm}$, the absolute error can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Absolute Error} = |\text{Measured Value} - \text{True Value}| = |10 \, \text{cm} - 9.8 \, \text{cm}| = 0.2 \, \text{cm}.
$$

Next, calculate the relative error by dividing the absolute error by the true value. In our example, the relative error is computed as:

$$
\text{Relative Error} = \frac{\text{Absolute Error}}{\text{True Value}} = \frac{0.2 \, \text{cm}}{9.8 \, \text{cm}} \approx 0.0204.
$$

Finally, to express the relative error as a percentage, multiply it by $100$:

$$
\text{Percentage Error} = \text{Relative Error} \times 100 \approx 0.0204 \times 100 \approx 2.04\%.
$$

It is crucial to understand that the percentage error measures the accuracy of the measurement, not its precision. Precision pertains to the level of detail or repeatability in the measurement, whereas accuracy indicates how close the measured value is to the true value.

In the field of physics, minimizing percentage error in measurements is essential for achieving reliable and accurate results. This can be accomplished through careful calibration of instruments, performing repeated measurements, and using appropriate units and significant figures.
