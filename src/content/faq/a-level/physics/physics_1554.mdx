The potential energy stored in a stretched rubber band can be determined using Hooke's Law.

According to Hooke's Law, the force required to stretch or compress a spring is directly proportional to the amount of extension or compression, provided that the elastic limit is not surpassed. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as:

$$
F = kx
$$

In this equation, $F$ represents the applied force, $x$ signifies the extension or compression of the spring, and $k$ denotes the spring constant.

The potential energy stored in a stretched rubber band is given by the formula:

$$
U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

Here, $U$ is the potential energy stored, $k$ is the spring constant of the rubber band, and $x$ is the extension of the rubber band.

To measure the extension of the rubber band, you can use a ruler or tape measure. The spring constant $k$ can be determined by applying a known force and measuring the resulting extension. This measurement can then be used in conjunction with Hooke's Law to calculate the value of $k$.

It's crucial to remember that the elastic limit of the rubber band should not be exceeded, as doing so may lead to permanent deformation, which can compromise the accuracy of your calculations.
