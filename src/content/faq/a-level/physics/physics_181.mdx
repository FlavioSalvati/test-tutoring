Radiation therapy is a medical treatment that targets cancer cells by damaging their DNA, ultimately preventing these cells from dividing.

This therapeutic approach utilizes high-energy radiation to effectively kill cancer cells by inflicting damage on their DNA. The reason radiation tends to harm cancer cells more than normal cells lies in the rapid division of cancer cells and their relatively ineffective DNA repair mechanisms. Radiation can be administered in two primary ways: externally, through a device known as a linear accelerator, or internally, via radioactive sources placed directly inside the body near the tumor.

The primary objective of radiation therapy is to deliver a sufficiently high dose of radiation to eradicate cancer cells while minimizing damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. Achieving this balance requires meticulous planning of the treatment, which involves advanced imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. These imaging methods help map the precise location of the cancer and its adjacent tissues. Consequently, the radiation is delivered in small, accurate doses over several weeks.

Radiation therapy can be employed as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with other cancer interventions, such as chemotherapy and surgery. Frequently, it is administered after surgical procedures to eliminate any residual cancer cells and decrease the likelihood of recurrence.

While radiation therapy is effective in destroying cancer cells, it is not without potential side effects. Common side effects include fatigue, skin irritation, and damage to nearby organs. The risk and severity of these side effects can vary based on factors such as the radiation dose, the specific location being treated, and the overall health of the individual.
