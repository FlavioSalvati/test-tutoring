Heat capacity refers to the total amount of energy required to increase the temperature of a substance.

In contrast, specific heat capacity is defined as the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one unit of mass of a substance by one degree Celsius. Thus, while heat capacity measures the energy required to elevate the temperature of an entire object by one degree Celsius, specific heat capacity is focused on a per-mass basis.

The specific heat capacity of a substance is an intrinsic property, meaning it is unique to that substance and does not vary with the amount of the substance present. This characteristic makes it particularly useful for comparing the thermal properties of different materials.

Heat capacity, however, is dependent on both the type and quantity of material involved. For instance, a large metal pot will exhibit a higher heat capacity than a small plastic cup, even if both contain the same volume of water.

In the realm of thermodynamics, heat capacity plays a crucial role in calculations related to the transfer of heat between objects. It is also important to recognize that heat capacity can change with variations in temperature, pressure, and other conditions.

In summary, while both heat capacity and specific heat capacity pertain to the energy required to increase the temperature of a substance, they differ in the scope of the material considered and the intrinsic properties of the substance involved.
