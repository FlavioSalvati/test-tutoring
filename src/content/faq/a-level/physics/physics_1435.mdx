The wave number, represented by the symbol $k$, quantifies the spatial frequency of a wave. Specifically, it indicates the number of wave cycles that pass through a given point per unit distance. The unit of wave number is reciprocal meters ($\text{m}^{-1}$). 

Wave number is intrinsically linked to wavelength, which is defined as the distance between two consecutive points on a wave that are in phase. The relationship between wave number and wavelength can be expressed by the formula:

$$
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
$$

where $\lambda$ denotes the wavelength.

Wave number plays a crucial role in various fields of physics, as it helps describe a wide array of wave phenomena, including electromagnetic waves, sound waves, and matter waves. In electromagnetic theory, the wave number is essential for understanding how electromagnetic waves propagate through different media. In quantum mechanics, wave number is significant for discussing the wave-like behavior of particles, such as electrons and photons.

Furthermore, wave number is related to the energy of a wave. The energy ($E$) of a wave is directly proportional to its frequency ($f$), and this relationship can be expressed with the equation:

$$
E = hf
$$

where $h$ represents Planck's constant. This connection is particularly important in the study of atomic and molecular spectra, where the energy levels of atoms and molecules are determined by the frequencies of the electromagnetic waves they emit or absorb.
