Natural frequency refers to the specific frequency at which an object vibrates when it is displaced from its equilibrium position.

When an object is disturbed from its equilibrium state, it will oscillate at a frequency known as its natural frequency. This frequency is influenced by several factors, including the object's mass, stiffness, and damping characteristics. For instance, the natural frequency of a pendulum is determined by its length and the acceleration due to gravity.

In contrast, forced frequency is defined as the frequency at which an external force is applied to an object. When an external force acts on an object at its natural frequency, a phenomenon known as resonance occurs. Resonance results in the object vibrating with a greater amplitude than it would at any other frequency.

The effects of resonance can be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on the context. For example, musical instruments capitalize on resonance to produce sound effectively. Conversely, resonance can lead to structural failures in buildings and bridges if they are subjected to vibrations matching their natural frequency.

In summary, natural frequency is the frequency at which an object vibrates when disturbed from its equilibrium position, while forced frequency is the frequency of an externally applied force. Resonance occurs when an object is subjected to an external force at its natural frequency, and it can have both advantageous and harmful consequences.
