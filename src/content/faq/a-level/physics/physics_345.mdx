To calculate the electric field resulting from a uniform charge distribution, we can employ Coulomb's law along with integration techniques.

Coulomb's law states that the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ at a point due to a point charge $q$ is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r$ from the charge. For a uniform charge distribution, we can divide the distribution into infinitesimal charge elements, denoted as $dq$, and utilize integration to determine the total electric field at a specific point.

Consider a uniform charge distribution along the x-axis. We can represent this distribution as a series of small charge elements $dq$. The electric field $\mathbf{dE}$ produced by each infinitesimal charge at a distance $r$ from the point of interest is expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{dE} = k \frac{dq}{r^2}
$$

where $k$ is the Coulomb constant.

To find the total electric field at a given point, we must integrate the contributions from all charge elements in the distribution. In the case of a one-dimensional uniform charge distribution, this integration simplifies to a straightforward calculation. The resulting total electric field $\mathbf{E}$ at the point due to the uniform charge distribution can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{E} = k \frac{Q}{r^2}
$$

where $Q$ represents the total charge and $r$ is the distance from the point of interest to the center of the charge distribution.

In summary, to calculate the electric field resulting from a uniform charge distribution, we should:
1. Divide the distribution into small charge elements.
2. Calculate the electric field contribution from each element using Coulomb's law.
3. Integrate these contributions to obtain the total electric field at the desired point.
