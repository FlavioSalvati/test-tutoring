Charge conjugation is a symmetry operation that transforms particles into their corresponding antiparticles by reversing their charge.

In the realm of particle physics, charge conjugation involves changing a particle into its antiparticle by altering its charge sign. For instance, a negatively charged electron is converted into a positively charged positron through this operation. Charge conjugation is commonly represented by the symbol $C$.

This operation is a fundamental symmetry in the laws of physics, indicating that the physical laws apply equally to both particles and antiparticles. However, charge conjugation is not a perfect symmetry, as certain particles exhibit different properties compared to their antiparticles. A notable example is the neutron and the antineutron; although they share the same mass and spin, they possess different lifetimes.

Charge conjugation is frequently analyzed alongside other symmetry operations, such as parity and time reversal. Together, these operations form what is known as CPT symmetry, which is believed to be a cornerstone of the fundamental laws governing the universe.

In summary, charge conjugation is a crucial symmetry operation that alters particles into their antiparticles by reversing their charge sign. While it represents a fundamental symmetry in physics, it is not absolute, as some particles and their antiparticles may exhibit differing properties.
