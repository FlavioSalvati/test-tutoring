The speed of a wave can be determined using the equation 

$$ 
v = f \lambda 
$$ 

where:

- $ v $ represents the wave speed,
- $ f $ denotes the frequency of the wave, and 
- $ \lambda $ (lambda) is the wavelength.

To accurately calculate the wave speed, it is essential to know both the frequency and the wavelength. The frequency, measured in Hertz (Hz), indicates the number of wave cycles that pass a specific point in one second. The wavelength, measured in meters (m), is defined as the distance between two consecutive points on the wave that are in phase.

The relationship between these quantities is derived from the fundamental wave equation 

$$ 
v = \frac{d}{t} 
$$ 

where $ d $ is the distance traveled by the wave and $ t $ is the time taken to travel that distance.

It is crucial to understand that the wave speed is independent of the wave's amplitude. This means that even if the amplitude (the height of the wave) changes, the wave speed will remain constant.

In summary, to find the wave speed of a particle, utilize the formula 

$$ 
v = f \lambda 
$$ 

where:

- $ v $ is the wave speed,
- $ f $ is the frequency (the number of waves passing a point per second), and
- $ \lambda $ is the wavelength (the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves).

Thus, by knowing the frequency and wavelength of a wave, you can easily compute its speed, regardless of any changes in amplitude.
