To calculate the voltage across a load in a DC circuit, use Ohm's Law: V = IR.

Ohm's Law states that the voltage (V) across a resistor (load) is equal to the current (I) flowing through it multiplied by the resistance (R) of the resistor. In a DC circuit, the voltage is constant, so the current and resistance determine the voltage across the load.

To apply Ohm's Law, you need to know the current flowing through the circuit and the resistance of the load. The current can be measured using an ammeter, and the resistance can be calculated using the load's specifications or measured using a multimeter.

Once you have the current and resistance values, simply multiply them together to get the voltage across the load. For example, if the current is 2 amps and the resistance of the load is 10 ohms, the voltage across the load would be 20 volts.

It's important to note that Ohm's Law only applies to resistive loads, and not to other types of loads such as capacitors or inductors. Additionally, in real-world circuits, there may be other factors such as voltage drops across wires or connections that can affect the voltage across the load.
