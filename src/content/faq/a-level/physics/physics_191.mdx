During neutron decay, a neutron is transformed into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino.

Neutron decay, commonly referred to as beta decay, is a form of radioactive decay that occurs when a neutron within an atomic nucleus converts into a proton, accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino. This process can take place in two distinct forms: beta-minus decay and beta-plus decay.

In beta-minus decay, a neutron converts into a proton while emitting a W$^{-}$ boson. This W$^{-}$ boson subsequently decays into an electron and an antineutrino. The emitted electron escapes from the nucleus, while the antineutrino is released into space. As a result, the proton remains within the nucleus, leading to an increase in the atomic number of the atom by one. This process is significant in the context of nuclear reactors and weapons, as it can instigate a chain reaction that releases substantial amounts of energy.

Conversely, in beta-plus decay, a proton transforms into a neutron, emitting a W$^{+}$ boson that decays into a positron and a neutrino. Similar to beta-minus decay, the emitted positron exits the nucleus, while the neutrino is released into space. In this case, the neutron stays in the nucleus, resulting in a decrease of the atomic number by one. Although beta-plus decay is less frequent than beta-minus decay, it plays a crucial role in medical imaging techniques, particularly in the detection of positron-emitting isotopes within the body.
