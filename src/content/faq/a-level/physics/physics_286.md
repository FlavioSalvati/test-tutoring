A cloud chamber is an innovative device designed to detect charged particles, such as electrons, protons, and alpha particles, by visualizing their paths through the formation of visible trails.

The cloud chamber consists of a sealed container filled with a supersaturated vapor, usually a mixture of alcohol and water. When a charged particle travels through this vapor, it ionizes the surrounding molecules along its trajectory, leading to the release of electrons. These freed electrons then attach to other molecules, resulting in the creation of a trail of ions.

As the ion trail moves through the vapor, it instigates a chain reaction of ionization, which produces a visible cloud of tiny droplets. These droplets condense around the ions, rendering the trail perceptible to the naked eye. This phenomenon can be captured through photography or video recording, enabling scientists to analyze the characteristics of the charged particle responsible for the trail.

Cloud chambers are widely utilized in particle physics research to investigate the properties of subatomic particles, including their mass, charge, and energy levels. Additionally, they serve an educational purpose by demonstrating the behavior of charged particles and the fundamental principles of radiation detection. However, in contemporary particle physics research, modern particle accelerators have largely supplanted cloud chambers due to their superior sensitivity and precision.
