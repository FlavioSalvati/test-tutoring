A bubble chamber is an innovative device designed to detect and visualize the paths of subatomic particles. It operates using a superheated liquid, typically liquid hydrogen or helium, contained within a sealed chamber. 

When a charged particle traverses the liquid, it ionizes the surrounding atoms and molecules along its pathway, resulting in a visible trail of charged particles. This ionization alters the pressure and temperature of the liquid, leading to the formation of bubbles as the liquid boils.

The bubbles generated by this trail can be captured in photographs and analyzed to extract valuable information about the particle that produced them. The characteristics of the bubbles—including their size and shape—can provide insights into the energy and momentum of the particle. Additionally, the curvature of the particle's trail can indicate its charge and mass.

Bubble chambers were extensively utilized in particle physics experiments during the mid-20th century. However, they have largely been supplanted by more advanced detection technologies, such as particle accelerators. Despite this, bubble chambers continue to serve as an effective educational tool, helping to illustrate the fundamental principles of particle physics.
