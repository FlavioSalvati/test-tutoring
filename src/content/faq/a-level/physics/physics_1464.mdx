To determine the uncertainty of a derived quantity, it is essential to consider the uncertainties associated with the measured quantities involved in the calculation.

When calculating a derived quantity, you are typically combining two or more measured quantities. Each of these quantities has its own uncertainty, which must be accounted for when evaluating the overall uncertainty of the derived quantity. The general principle states that the uncertainty of the derived quantity can be calculated using the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties.

For instance, consider the calculation of the velocity of an object using the equation:

$$ v = \frac{d}{t} $$

where $d$ represents distance and $t$ represents time. In this case, it is vital to include the uncertainties in both distance and time. Suppose the distance has an uncertainty of $\pm 0.1 \, \text{m}$ and the time has an uncertainty of $\pm 0.05 \, \text{s}$. The uncertainty in the velocity can be calculated as follows:

$$ \text{Uncertainty in } v = \sqrt{(0.1)^2 + (0.05)^2} = \pm 0.11 \, \text{m/s} $$

It is important to emphasize that this method assumes the uncertainties in the measured quantities are independent and random. If there are systematic errors or correlations between the measured quantities, a more sophisticated analysis may be necessary.

In summary, to accurately determine the uncertainty of a derived quantity, you must consider the uncertainties of the measured quantities involved in the calculation and apply the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties.
