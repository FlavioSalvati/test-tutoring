Capacitive reactance is the resistance encountered by alternating current (AC) as it flows through a capacitor. 

This opposition to the flow of AC is quantified by capacitive reactance, denoted as $X_c$, and its unit of measurement is ohms ($\Omega$). The value of capacitive reactance is influenced by two key factors: the frequency of the alternating current, denoted as $f$, and the capacitance of the capacitor, denoted as $C$. Specifically, as the frequency increases, the capacitive reactance decreases. Conversely, an increase in capacitance also results in a decrease in capacitive reactance.

The relationship between capacitive reactance, frequency, and capacitance can be expressed mathematically through the formula:

$$
X_c = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
$$

In this equation, $f$ represents the frequency of the alternating current in hertz (Hz), and $C$ denotes the capacitance in farads (F). This formula illustrates that capacitive reactance is inversely proportional to the frequency and directly proportional to the capacitance.
