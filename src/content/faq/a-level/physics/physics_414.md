Stellar spectra serve as a crucial tool for determining the chemical composition, temperature, and motion of stars.

Stellar spectra refer to the electromagnetic radiation emitted by stars, which offers valuable insights into their properties. By analyzing these spectra, astronomers can identify the elements present in a star since each element produces a distinct set of spectral lines. This information enables the classification of stars into various spectral types, including O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, which are categorized based on their surface temperatures.

The temperature of a star can also be inferred from its spectrum. The intensity of the radiation emitted by a star correlates with its temperature. Specifically, cooler stars tend to emit a greater intensity of radiation in the red region of the spectrum, whereas hotter stars emit more radiation in the blue region.

In addition to chemical composition and temperature, stellar spectra can be employed to ascertain the motion of stars. The Doppler effect results in a shift of the spectral lines toward the red or blue ends of the spectrum, depending on whether the star is moving away from or toward us. By measuring this shift, astronomers can calculate the radial velocity of a star, which is essential for studying its motion and orbital dynamics.

In summary, stellar spectra are an invaluable resource for astronomers, enabling them to investigate the properties and behaviors of stars in the universe.
