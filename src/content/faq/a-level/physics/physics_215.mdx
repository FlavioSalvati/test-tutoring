The orientation of a coil significantly influences the electromotive force (EMF) induced by electromagnetic induction.

When a coil is moved through a magnetic field, an EMF is generated within the coil. The magnitude of this induced EMF is directly related to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the coil. Magnetic flux is defined as the product of the magnetic field strength and the area of the coil that is perpendicular to the magnetic field.

When the coil is oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field, the maximum amount of magnetic flux passes through the coil, resulting in the highest induced EMF. Conversely, if the coil is aligned parallel to the magnetic field, the magnetic flux through the coil becomes zero, which means no EMF is induced.

If the coil is positioned at an angle relative to the magnetic field, the magnetic flux passing through the coil will be less than its maximum value, leading to a correspondingly lower induced EMF. The angle between the coil and the magnetic field is referred to as the angle of incidence.
