The rotation curves of galaxies are closely linked to the concept of dark matter through its gravitational effects.

Galaxies rotate around their centers, and it is generally expected that the rotational speed would decrease as one moves farther from the center. However, observations have revealed that the rotation curves of many galaxies remain flat, suggesting the presence of significantly more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter alone. This discrepancy points to the existence of dark matter.

Dark matter is a theoretical form of matter that does not interact with light or any other form of electromagnetic radiation, rendering it invisible to telescopes. Despite its invisibility, dark matter possesses mass and, consequently, exerts a gravitational force on nearby objects. The presence of dark matter helps to explain the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies, as the additional mass associated with dark matter provides the necessary gravitational pull to maintain the outer regions of the galaxy at the same rotational speed as the inner regions.

The precise nature of dark matter remains unknown, and scientists are actively engaged in research to develop theories that elucidate its properties. Nonetheless, the evidence supporting the existence of dark matter is robust, with its gravitational effects on the rotation curves of galaxies serving as some of the most persuasive indicators of its presence.
