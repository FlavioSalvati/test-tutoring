The age of the universe is estimated using several methods, including the analysis of cosmic microwave background radiation and observations of supernovae.

One significant approach to estimating the universe's age involves studying cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). This radiation is the residual heat from the Big Bang and permeates the entire universe. By measuring the temperature fluctuations and distribution of the CMB, scientists have estimated the age of the universe to be approximately $13.8$ billion years.

Another method for estimating the universe's age is through the observation of supernovae. These spectacular events occur when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel and collapses, resulting in a tremendous explosion. By measuring the brightness and distance of these supernovae, researchers have determined the age of the universe to be around $13.7$ billion years.

Additional techniques for estimating the universe's age include examining the Hubble constant, which describes the relationship between the universe's expansion rate and its age, and analyzing the chemical composition of the oldest known stars.

While these methods yield valuable estimates for the universe's age, there remains some uncertainty about the precise figure due to the limitations of current technology and our understanding of cosmic phenomena. Nevertheless, these estimates offer crucial insights into the universe's history and evolution.
