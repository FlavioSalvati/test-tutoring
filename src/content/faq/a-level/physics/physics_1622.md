The Standard Model of particle physics identifies three fundamental types of interactions: electromagnetic, weak, and strong.

The **electromagnetic interaction** governs the forces between electrically charged particles, such as electrons and protons. This force is mediated by the exchange of photons, which are massless particles responsible for carrying the electromagnetic force. Everyday phenomena, like the attraction between magnets and the flow of electricity through wires, can be attributed to this interaction.

The **weak interaction** is responsible for processes such as particle decay, including beta decay, in which a neutron transforms into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. This interaction is mediated by the exchange of W and Z bosons, which are massive particles that facilitate the weak force. Notably, the weak interaction is significantly weaker than both the electromagnetic and strong interactions, which explains why certain particles can decay over time.

The **strong interaction** is the force that holds quarks together, the fundamental constituents of protons and neutrons. This interaction is mediated by gluons, which are also massless particles that carry the strong force. The strong interaction is extremely powerful at short ranges but diminishes with increasing distance, which is why quarks are never found in isolation; they are always confined within larger particles.

In summary, the Standard Model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the interactions between particles and the forces that dictate their behavior. This foundational theory of particle physics has been rigorously tested through numerous experiments, affirming its validity.
