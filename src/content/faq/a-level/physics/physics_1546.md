The fundamental particles that constitute the universe can be categorized into three primary types: quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons.

**Quarks** serve as the essential building blocks of protons and neutrons, which together form the nucleus of an atom. There are six distinct types of quarks, namely: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Each quark has a corresponding antiquark that possesses an opposite charge.

**Leptons** are a separate class of particles that do not engage in interactions mediated by the strong nuclear force, unlike quarks. There are also six types of leptons: the electron, muon, tau, electron neutrino, muon neutrino, and tau neutrino. The electron is perhaps the most recognized lepton, playing a vital role in electricity and magnetism.

**Gauge bosons** are the particles responsible for mediating the fundamental forces of nature. There are four key types of gauge bosons: the photon, W and Z bosons, and gluons. The photon mediates the electromagnetic force, while the W and Z bosons facilitate the weak nuclear force. Gluons are responsible for mediating the strong nuclear force.

In addition to these three primary categories of fundamental particles, the **Higgs boson** was discovered in 2012. The Higgs boson is crucial for imparting mass to other particles and plays an integral role in the Standard Model of particle physics.

Comprehending the different types of fundamental particles is essential for grasping the nature of matter and the universe as a whole. Through ongoing research and experimentation, scientists continue to unveil new insights into these particles and their interactions.
