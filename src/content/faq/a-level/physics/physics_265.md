Leptons are a category of elementary particles that do not engage in interactions mediated by the strong nuclear force. There are six distinct types of leptons, each associated with its own antiparticle:

- Electron ($e^-$) and its corresponding neutrino ($\nu_e$)
- Muon ($\mu^-$) and its corresponding neutrino ($\nu_\mu$)
- Tau ($\tau^-$) and its corresponding neutrino ($\nu_\tau$)

Among these, the electron is the most widely recognized lepton, primarily because it is a fundamental component of atoms, where it orbits the nucleus. The muon resembles the electron but is significantly heavier and possesses a much shorter lifetime. The tau particle, even heavier than the muon, has an even shorter lifespan. Notably, all three charged leptons carry a negative electric charge.

In contrast, neutrinos are neutral particles that are considerably lighter than their charged counterparts. Due to their extremely weak interactions with matter, neutrinos are notoriously difficult to detect. They are generated in various nuclear processes, such as those occurring in the Sun, as well as during cosmic ray interactions with the Earth's atmosphere.

Leptons play a crucial role in particle physics as they are fundamental entities that cannot be subdivided into smaller constituents. Additionally, they hold significance in astrophysics, as they are produced in high-energy phenomena such as supernovae, providing valuable insights into the conditions present in these extreme environments.
