A gamma-ray burst (GRB) is an exceptionally powerful explosion that emits gamma rays from a distant source in space.

Gamma-ray bursts are considered the most energetic events in the universe, releasing more energy in just a few seconds than the Sun will emit over its entire lifespan. These bursts are believed to be triggered by the collapse of massive stars or the collision of two neutron stars. Although GRBs emit radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, they are most effectively detected in the gamma-ray range.

GRBs are categorized into two distinct types: long and short. Long GRBs typically last from several seconds to minutes and are associated with the collapse of massive stars. In contrast, short GRBs last for less than $2$ seconds and are thought to result from the merger of two neutron stars.

The study of gamma-ray bursts has provided invaluable insights into the early universe, as these events can be detected from billions of light-years away. They have also been instrumental in testing fundamental theories in physics, including the theory of relativity. Furthermore, GRBs have practical applications, such as assisting in the calibration of instruments on satellites and spacecraft.

Despite their significance, many aspects of GRBs remain enigmatic. Scientists continue to investigate these powerful explosions to gain a deeper understanding of their origins and characteristics.
