In nuclear physics, there are several distinct types of decay modes, including alpha decay, beta decay, gamma decay, and neutron decay. Each of these decay processes has unique characteristics that play a critical role in our understanding of nuclear reactions.

**Alpha Decay**  
Alpha decay occurs when an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. As a result of this emission, the atomic number decreases by $2$ and the mass number decreases by $4$. This process typically occurs in heavy nuclei and leads to the formation of a new element.

**Beta Decay**  
Beta decay involves the transformation of a neutron within the nucleus into a proton, accompanied by the emission of an electron, known as a beta particle. This process results in an increase of the atomic number by $1$, while the mass number remains unchanged. Beta decay is significant in the study of weak nuclear forces.

**Gamma Decay**  
Gamma decay is characterized by the release of energy from an excited nucleus in the form of gamma rays, which are high-energy photons. This decay mode does not alter either the atomic number or the mass number, but it often follows other types of decay, as the nucleus transitions to a lower energy state.

**Neutron Decay**  
Neutron decay occurs when a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton, an electron, and an anti-neutrino. This process also results in an increase of the atomic number by $1$, while the mass number remains unchanged. This decay is a form of beta decay, emphasizing the transformation of a neutron into a proton.

Each decay mode provides valuable insights into different aspects of nuclear physics and is essential for various applications, including nuclear energy generation and medical technologies. Understanding these decay processes is crucial for advancing our knowledge in these fields.
