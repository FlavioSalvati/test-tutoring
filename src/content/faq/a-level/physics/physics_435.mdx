To determine the total current in a parallel DC circuit, we utilize both Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Current Law.

In a parallel circuit, the current divides among various branches and subsequently reconvenes at the junction. The total current flowing through the circuit is the sum of the currents in each individual branch. According to Ohm's Law, the current in a given branch can be expressed as the voltage across that branch divided by its resistance. Thus, it is essential to calculate the current in each branch independently.

Kirchhoff's Current Law states that the total current entering a junction must equal the total current exiting that junction. This principle serves as a valuable tool for verifying your calculations. If the sum of the currents calculated for each branch does not match the total current, it indicates an error in your computations.

To find the total current, follow these steps:
1. Calculate the current in each branch using Ohm's Law.
2. Sum the currents from all branches.

For instance, consider a scenario with three branches having resistances of $10 \, \Omega$, $20 \, \Omega$, and $30 \, \Omega$, with a voltage of $12 \, V$ applied across the branches. The current in each branch can be calculated as follows:
- For the $10 \, \Omega$ branch: 
$$ I_1 = \frac{V}{R_1} = \frac{12 \, V}{10 \, \Omega} = 1.2 \, A $$
- For the $20 \, \Omega$ branch: 
$$ I_2 = \frac{V}{R_2} = \frac{12 \, V}{20 \, \Omega} = 0.6 \, A $$
- For the $30 \, \Omega$ branch: 
$$ I_3 = \frac{V}{R_3} = \frac{12 \, V}{30 \, \Omega} = 0.4 \, A $$

Adding these currents together gives us the total current:
$$ I_{total} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = 1.2 \, A + 0.6 \, A + 0.4 \, A = 2.2 \, A $$

In summary, to calculate the total current in a parallel DC circuit, apply Ohm's Law to compute the current in each branch, and then sum these currents. You can also employ Kirchhoff's Current Law to verify your results and ensure the accuracy of your calculations.
