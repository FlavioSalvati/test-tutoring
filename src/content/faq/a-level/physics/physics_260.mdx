The strength of an object's gravitational field increases with its mass.

A gravitational field is defined as the region surrounding an object where another object will experience an attractive force towards it. This force is directly proportional to the mass of the object generating the field. Thus, a larger mass results in a stronger gravitational field.

This relationship is encapsulated in the equation for gravitational force:

$$
F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

In this equation, $ F $ represents the gravitational force of attraction, $ G $ is the gravitational constant, $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses of the two interacting objects, and $ r $ is the distance between their centers. As the mass of either object (either $ m_1 $ or $ m_2 $) increases, the gravitational force $ F $ between the two objects also increases.

For instance, the gravitational field of the Earth is significantly stronger than that of the Moon due to the Earth's greater mass. This difference in mass explains why objects on Earth experience a stronger gravitational pull than those on the Moon.

In conclusion, the mass of an object has a direct impact on the strength of its gravitational field. The larger the mass, the stronger the gravitational field, resulting in a greater force of attraction between objects.
