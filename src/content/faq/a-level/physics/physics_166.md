Radiocarbon dating, also referred to as carbon-14 dating, is a scientific technique employed to ascertain the age of organic materials, such as wood, charcoal, and bone. This method is grounded in the principle that carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon, is continuously produced in the atmosphere and subsequently absorbed by living organisms. Upon the death of an organism, it ceases to absorb carbon-14, leading to a gradual decline in the amount of this isotope present in its remains due to radioactive decay.

The decay rate of carbon-14 is well characterized, with a half-life of approximately $5,700$ years. By measuring the residual amount of carbon-14 in a sample and comparing it to the estimated initial concentration, scientists can calculate the time elapsed since the organism's death. This dating method is reliable for specimens up to about $50,000$ years old.

Radiocarbon dating has significantly enhanced our comprehension of historical timelines, enabling researchers to establish the ages of ancient artifacts and fossils with remarkable accuracy. It has been applied to date a wide range of items, including the Shroud of Turin, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the remains of King Tutankhamun. Despite its many successes, radiocarbon dating has certain limitations; it is applicable only to organic materials and can be affected by contamination and other potential sources of error. Nevertheless, it remains one of the most valuable tools in the archaeologist's toolkit, profoundly influencing our understanding of the past.
