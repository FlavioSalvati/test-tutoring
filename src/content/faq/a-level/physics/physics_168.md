Elastic potential energy is stored in a deformed spring as a result of the stretching or compression of its coils.

When a force is applied to a spring, it undergoes deformation, causing its coils to either stretch or compress. This deformation enables the spring to store energy, specifically known as elastic potential energy. The quantity of energy stored in the spring is influenced by both the extent of the deformation and the spring constant, which quantifies the stiffness of the spring.

The formula for calculating the elastic potential energy ($E$) stored in a spring is given by:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

In this equation:

- $E$ represents the elastic potential energy,
- $k$ denotes the spring constant, and
- $x$ signifies the amount of deformation.

This equation illustrates that the energy stored in the spring is directly proportional to both the degree of deformation and the spring constant.

When the applied force is removed, the spring reverts to its original shape, releasing the stored energy as kinetic energy. This characteristic is why springs are widely utilized in various devices, such as shock absorbers and toys, to provide a source of energy for movement.

In summary, elastic potential energy accumulates in a deformed spring due to the stretching or compression of its coils. The total energy stored is contingent upon the degree of deformation and the spring constant, and it is released as kinetic energy once the force is withdrawn.
