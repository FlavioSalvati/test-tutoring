The magnifying power of a telescope is fundamentally based on the principle of angular magnification.

When light enters a telescope, it first passes through the objective lens, which creates an image of the distant object. This image is then further magnified by the eyepiece lens, which functions similarly to a magnifying glass. The angular magnification of the telescope is defined as the ratio of the angle subtended by the image viewed through the telescope to the angle subtended by the object as seen with the naked eye.

The magnifying power, denoted as $M$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
M = \frac{f_o}{f_e}
$$

In this equation, $f_o$ represents the focal length of the objective lens, while $f_e$ denotes the focal length of the eyepiece lens. To increase the magnifying power of a telescope, one can either increase the focal length of the objective lens or decrease the focal length of the eyepiece lens.

However, it is important to note that increasing the magnifying power can lead to a reduced field of view and may complicate the focusing process. Thus, a careful balance must be maintained between achieving greater magnification and ensuring user-friendliness. Additionally, the quality of the lenses and the precise alignment of the telescope are crucial factors that can influence its magnifying power.

In summary, the magnifying power of a telescope is a key consideration when selecting a telescope for stargazing or other astronomical observations.
