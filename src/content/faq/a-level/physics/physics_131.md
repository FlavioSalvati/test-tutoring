To determine the total resistance in a direct current (DC) circuit, you must sum all the individual resistances.

In a DC circuit, resistors can be connected in either series or parallel configurations. 

**Series Connection:**
When resistors are connected in series, the total resistance is simply the sum of all individual resistances. This is because the same current flows through each resistor, and the total voltage drop across the resistors is equal to the sum of the voltage drops across each one. To calculate the total resistance in a series circuit, use the following formula:

$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots
$$

Here, $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, etc., represent the individual resistances of the resistors in the series.

**Parallel Connection:**
In contrast, when resistors are connected in parallel, the total resistance is less than the smallest individual resistance. This occurs because the current is divided among the resistors, resulting in each resistor carrying less current than it would in a series circuit. To calculate the total resistance in a parallel circuit, apply the following formula:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots
$$

Once you have determined the total resistance, you can apply Ohm's Law, given by the equation $V = IR$, to calculate the current flowing through the circuit or to find the power dissipated by the resistors using the formula $P = IV$.
