The resonant frequency of a circuit is influenced by both its capacitance and inductance.

Capacitance and inductance are crucial factors that determine the resonant frequency of a circuit. The resonant frequency is defined as the frequency at which the circuit oscillates with maximum amplitude. In a series resonant circuit, the resonant frequency can be expressed using the formula:

$$
f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}
$$

where $L$ represents the inductance of the circuit and $C$ signifies the capacitance.

Capacitance impacts the resonant frequency by determining the amount of electrical charge that the circuit can store. Specifically, a higher capacitance allows for a greater charge to be stored, leading to a lower resonant frequency. This occurs because the circuit takes longer to discharge and recharge, resulting in an extended period of oscillation.

Conversely, inductance influences the resonant frequency by dictating the amount of energy that can be stored in the circuit's magnetic field. A higher inductance permits more energy storage, which consequently raises the resonant frequency. This is due to the fact that the circuit can oscillate more rapidly when there is a larger amount of energy stored in the magnetic field.

In conclusion, both capacitance and inductance are significant in determining a circuit's resonant frequency. An increase in capacitance will lead to a decrease in resonant frequency, while an increase in inductance will result in a higher resonant frequency.
