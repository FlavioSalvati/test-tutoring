Voltage, current, and power are fundamentally interconnected in an electrical circuit, meaning that a change in one of these quantities will influence the others.

**Voltage** is measured in volts ($V$) and represents the potential difference between two points in a circuit. It serves as the driving force that pushes electrons, or current, through the circuit. A higher voltage indicates a greater potential for current to flow.

**Current**, measured in amperes ($A$), refers to the flow of electrons within the circuit. According to Ohm's Law, current is directly proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to resistance, expressed mathematically as:

$$
I = \frac{V}{R}
$$

This relationship implies that increasing the voltage or decreasing the resistance will result in an increase in current.

**Power**, measured in watts ($W$), quantifies the rate at which energy is transferred within the circuit. Power can be calculated using the formula:

$$
P = VI
$$

This equation indicates that power output is the product of voltage and current. Thus, increasing either voltage or current will enhance the power output of the circuit.

In conclusion, voltage acts as the essential driving force for current flow, while the resistance present in the circuit serves to limit this flow. The power output is determined by both voltage and current, and it can be augmented by increasing either of these parameters. A thorough understanding of the relationships between voltage, current, and power is crucial for effective circuit design and analysis.
