Wave coherence describes the relationship between two waves that maintain a constant phase difference.

When two waves are coherent, they exhibit a fixed phase difference, which means that their peaks and troughs align perfectly. This coherence can be achieved through various methods, such as utilizing a single source to generate both waves or employing a beam splitter to divide a single wave into two coherent waves.

Coherence is a fundamental principle in numerous fields of physics, including optics and quantum mechanics. In optics, coherent light sources play a crucial role in applications like holography and interferometry. In quantum mechanics, coherence is vital for phenomena such as superposition and entanglement.

The concept of coherence length can be used to quantify wave coherence. Coherence length is defined as the distance over which the phase relationship between two waves remains consistent. This distance depends on factors such as the wavelength of the waves and the quality of the wave source.

In summary, the principle of wave coherence is essential for understanding and manipulating waves across various areas of physics. It is a fundamental concept that A-Level Physics students should master.
