X-rays play a crucial role in mammography, a technique used to create detailed images of breast tissue for the early detection of breast cancer.

Mammography is a specialized medical imaging method that utilizes low-dose X-rays to generate images of the breast tissue. This technique is vital for identifying breast cancer at its earliest stages, often before any noticeable symptoms arise. During the procedure, X-rays are generated by an X-ray machine and directed toward the breast. To optimize the imaging process and minimize radiation exposure, the breast is compressed between two plates, which spreads out the tissue.

As the X-rays traverse the breast tissue, they are absorbed to varying degrees by different types of tissue. Dense tissues, such as breast tissue, absorb more X-rays compared to fatty tissues, which appear darker on the mammogram. Additionally, cancerous tissues tend to absorb more X-rays than healthy tissue, often manifesting as a white spot on the mammogram.

After the images are captured, they are reviewed by a radiologist, who examines them for any signs of abnormalities or changes in the breast tissue. If any suspicious findings are detected, further diagnostic tests may be necessary to ascertain whether the abnormality is cancerous.

Mammography is an essential tool for the early detection of breast cancer and can significantly contribute to saving lives. Health professionals recommend that women aged $50$ and older undergo mammography screenings every two years. Furthermore, women with a family history of breast cancer may need to begin screenings at an earlier age to ensure timely detection.
