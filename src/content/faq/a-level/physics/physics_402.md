Energy is released during a nuclear reaction through the conversion of mass into energy.

In a nuclear reaction, the nucleus of an atom undergoes either splitting (a process known as nuclear fission) or combining with another nucleus (known as nuclear fusion). In both scenarios, a small fraction of mass is transformed into energy in accordance with Einstein's renowned equation, $E=mc^2$. This indicates that even a minuscule amount of mass can yield a significant quantity of energy.

In the process of nuclear fission, a heavy nucleus, such as uranium-235, is bombarded with neutrons, leading to its division into two smaller nuclei. This reaction also releases several neutrons and a substantial amount of energy, primarily in the form of heat. This heat can then be utilized to generate electricity in nuclear power plants.

Conversely, nuclear fusion involves the merging of two light nuclei, such as hydrogen isotopes, to create a heavier nucleus, releasing energy in the process. This is the very mechanism that powers the sun and other stars. Presently, scientists are engaged in research to harness nuclear fusion as a clean and sustainable energy source on Earth.

In summary, nuclear reactions convert a small amount of mass into a vast amount of energy, which can be utilized for various applications. However, it is essential to recognize that nuclear reactions also present potential dangers and risks that require careful management and control.
