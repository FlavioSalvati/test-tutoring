To determine the molar mass of a gas using the ideal gas law, we first need to rearrange the equation.

The ideal gas law is expressed as:

$$
PV = nRT
$$

where:
- $ P $ represents pressure,
- $ V $ denotes volume,
- $ n $ indicates the number of moles,
- $ R $ is the ideal gas constant, and
- $ T $ stands for temperature in Kelvin.

To find the number of moles $ n $, we can rearrange the equation to:

$$
n = \frac{PV}{RT}
$$

Once we have calculated the number of moles, we can find the molar mass by dividing the mass of the gas by the number of moles:

$$
\text{Molar Mass} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{n}
$$

The mass of the gas can be determined either by weighing a sample directly or by using its density and volume. For instance, if we have a gas sample with a mass of $2$ grams and it contains $0.1$ moles, we can calculate the molar mass as follows:

$$
\text{Molar Mass} = \frac{2 \text{ grams}}{0.1 \text{ moles}} = 20 \text{ grams per mole}
$$

It is essential to recognize that the ideal gas law assumes the gas behaves ideally. This means the gas is typically at low pressure and high temperature, and that the gas molecules do not interact significantly with one another. In reality, most gases exhibit some degree of deviation from ideal behavior, so the calculated molar mass may not be perfectly accurate.
