The strength of the gravitational field decreases as altitude increases.

As an object ascends further from the Earth's surface, the distance between the object and the center of the Earth increases. This increased distance leads to a reduction in the gravitational force acting on the object, which varies inversely with the square of the distance between the two masses. Consequently, as altitude rises, the gravitational field strength diminishes.

This relationship can be expressed mathematically using the equation:

$$
F = \frac{G m M}{r^2}
$$

where:
- $F$ represents the gravitational force,
- $G$ is the gravitational constant,
- $m$ and $M$ denote the masses of the two objects,
- $r$ is the distance between their centers.

As the distance $r$ increases, the gravitational force $F$ correspondingly decreases.

The impact of altitude on gravitational field strength is also reflected in the weight of objects. An object's weight is defined as its mass multiplied by the gravitational field strength. Therefore, as the gravitational field strength diminishes with increasing altitude, the weight of objects also decreases. This phenomenon is why astronauts experience weightlessness in space; they are at such a height above the Earth's surface that the gravitational force acting on them becomes negligible.

In summary, altitude significantly influences gravitational field strength. As altitude increases, the gravitational force acting on objects decreases, leading to a reduction in weight and the sensation of weightlessness experienced by astronauts in space.
