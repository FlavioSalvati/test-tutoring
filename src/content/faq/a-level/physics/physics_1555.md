The finite speed of light imposes significant limitations on our perception of the universe.

Light is the fastest entity in the cosmos, traveling at an astonishing speed of approximately $299,792,458$ meters per second in a vacuum. This finite speed means that light from distant celestial objects requires time to reach us. Consequently, the farther away an object is, the longer its light takes to arrive.

For instance, the nearest star to our solar system, Proxima Centauri, is located about $4.24$ light-years away. This distance implies that the light we observe from Proxima Centauri today actually departed from the star over four years ago. Therefore, we are witnessing the star as it appeared four years in the past, rather than its current state.

The speed of light also defines the limits of the observable universe. The universe is estimated to be approximately $13.8$ billion years old, which means that the light from the most distant objects we can observe has been traveling towards us for $13.8$ billion years. Any object situated beyond this distance has not yet had its light reach us.

In summary, the speed of light constrains our view of the universe in two significant ways: it causes distant objects to appear as they were in the past and it restricts the extent of the observable universe.
