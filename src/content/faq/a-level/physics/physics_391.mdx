summary: "A black hole is created when a massive star collapses due to its own gravitational force, resulting in an area in space with an intense gravitational pull from which nothing can escape."

A black hole is formed when a massive star collapses under the influence of its own gravity.

As a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer generate the energy necessary to counterbalance the gravitational forces acting upon it. This leads to the collapse of the star's core, which triggers a spectacular explosion known as a supernova. If the core's mass is sufficiently great, it will continue to collapse until it reaches a singularityâ€”a point of infinite density and zero volume. This singularity is encircled by an event horizon, a boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.

The formation of a black hole is contingent upon the mass of the collapsing star. Specifically, stars with a mass less than $3$ times that of the Sun will evolve into a white dwarf or a neutron star. Stars with a mass ranging from $3$ to $20$ times that of the Sun will undergo a supernova explosion, ultimately resulting in the formation of a black hole. Meanwhile, stars with a mass exceeding $20$ times that of the Sun can form a black hole without a supernova, through a process known as pair instability.

Black holes are among the most enigmatic objects in the universe, and their formation is merely one facet of their mysterious nature. Investigating black holes can significantly enhance our understanding of fundamental physical laws, as well as the nature of space and time.
