The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram illustrates the relationship between a star's luminosity and its surface temperature, providing valuable insights into the stages of stellar evolution.

The Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram is a graphical representation that plots a star's luminosity against its surface temperature. This diagram reveals distinct patterns, with stars occupying different regions that correspond to various stages of their evolutionary processes. For example, stars in the main sequence are in a stable state, where they convert hydrogen into helium in their cores. As these stars deplete their hydrogen fuel, they transition off the main sequence and expand into red giants. Although red giants are significantly larger than main-sequence stars, they possess lower temperatures and luminosities.

Furthermore, the H-R diagram highlights the correlation between a star's mass and its position on the plot. More massive stars are typically hotter and more luminous than their less massive counterparts. The most massive stars are situated in the upper left corner of the diagram, while the least massive stars are found in the lower right corner.

The H-R diagram also provides insights into the final stages of stellar evolution. As a star runs out of nuclear fuel, it eventually sheds its outer layers, leading to the formation of a planetary nebula. The remnant core of the star, known as a white dwarf, occupies the lower left corner of the diagram, characterized by low luminosity and high temperature.

In summary, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram serves as a powerful tool for understanding the various stages of stellar evolution. By plotting a star's luminosity and temperature, we can infer its mass, determine its evolutionary stage, and predict its eventual fate.
