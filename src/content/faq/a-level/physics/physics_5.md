X-rays play a crucial role in medical imaging by passing through the body and being absorbed at varying degrees by different types of tissues.

X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation characterized by high energy and short wavelengths. As X-rays traverse the body, their absorption varies among tissues. Dense structures, such as bones, absorb a greater amount of X-rays, which makes them appear white on the resulting image. In contrast, less dense tissues, such as muscles and organs, absorb fewer X-rays, resulting in a darker appearance on the image.

To create an X-ray image, the patient is positioned between an X-ray machine and a detector. The X-ray machine emits a beam of X-rays that penetrates the body and strikes the detector. This detector captures the pattern of X-rays that have successfully passed through the body, generating an image that can be analyzed by a radiologist.

X-rays are widely used in medical imaging for the diagnosis and monitoring of various conditions, including fractures, dental issues, and lung diseases. However, it is important to note that X-rays can pose health risks if misused or administered in excessive doses. To minimize potential harm, medical professionals implement safety measures, such as limiting the frequency of X-ray examinations and using lead shields to protect sensitive parts of the body.
