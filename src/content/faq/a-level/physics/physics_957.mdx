An inductor functions in a filter circuit by permitting low-frequency signals to pass while obstructing high-frequency ones.

Inductors are passive components that store energy in a magnetic field. Within a filter circuit, they are specifically designed to block high-frequency signals and allow low-frequency signals to traverse. This behavior arises from the inductor's characteristic of presenting high impedance to high-frequency signals and low impedance to low-frequency signals.

In a low-pass filter circuit, the inductor is connected in series with the load and the output. This arrangement facilitates the passage of low-frequency signals through the inductor to the load, while high-frequency signals are impeded. Consequently, the inductor effectively acts as a barrier to high frequencies, enabling only low-frequency signals to pass through.
