To calculate the power dissipated in a resistor, you can utilize the formulas $ P = VI $ or $ P = I^2R $.

Power dissipation in a resistor refers to the energy converted into heat as electric current passes through it. This can be determined using the formula $ P = VI $, where $ P $ represents power in watts, $ V $ is the voltage in volts, and $ I $ is the current in amperes. Alternatively, you can apply the formula $ P = I^2R $, where $ R $ is the resistance measured in ohms.

It's crucial to understand that power dissipation can lead to an increase in temperature within the resistor, which may impact its performance and longevity. To mitigate the risk of overheating, it is essential to select a resistor with a power rating that exceeds the anticipated power dissipation.

In certain scenarios, you may need to calculate the total power dissipation of an entire circuit rather than just a single resistor. This can be achieved by summing the power dissipation of each individual resistor within the circuit.
