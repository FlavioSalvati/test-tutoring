To determine the voltage drop in a series DC circuit, we can apply both Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law.

Ohm's Law defines the relationship between voltage ($V$), current ($I$), and resistance ($R$) with the formula:

$$ V = I \cdot R $$

In a series circuit, the total resistance ($R_T$) is simply the sum of all the individual resistances ($R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, etc.). Consequently, the current ($I$) remains constant throughout the circuit.

Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) states that the sum of all voltage drops around a closed loop equals the voltage supplied by the source. In a series circuit, the voltage drop across each resistor ($V_{R_1}$, $V_{R_2}$, $V_{R_3}$, etc.) combines to equal the total voltage provided by the source ($V_S$).

To calculate the voltage drop across a specific resistor, such as $R_2$, you can follow these steps:

1. Use Ohm's Law to determine the total current ($I$) by first calculating the total resistance ($R_T$).
2. Apply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law to find the voltage drops across the other resistors, $R_1$ and $R_3$.
3. Finally, subtract the sum of the voltage drops across $R_1$ and $R_3$ from the total voltage supplied by the source ($V_S$) to obtain the voltage drop across $R_2$.

In summary, to calculate the voltage drop in a series DC circuit, utilize Ohm's Law to find the total current and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law to assess the voltage drops across each resistor.
