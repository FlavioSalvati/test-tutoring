A thyristor is a semiconductor device that functions as a switch within an electrical circuit.

Thyristors are particularly useful in applications where control over high currents or voltages is necessary. They feature three terminals: an anode, a cathode, and a gate. When a voltage is applied to the gate, the thyristor activates, allowing current to flow from the anode to the cathode. Notably, once the thyristor is turned on, it continues to conduct current even if the gate voltage is subsequently removed.

The operation of a thyristor is based on a principle known as regenerative feedback. When a small current is introduced at the gate, it initiates a larger current flow from the anode to the cathode. This increased current then triggers an even greater flow, establishing a positive feedback loop that rapidly turns the thyristor on.

To turn off the thyristor, the current flowing through it must be reduced to zero. This can be accomplished by either lowering the voltage across the thyristor or applying a reverse voltage. Once the current reaches zero, the thyristor turns off and ceases to conduct.

Thyristors are widely utilized in power control circuits, including motor control applications and lighting dimmers. They are also integral components in electronic switches and inverter circuits.
