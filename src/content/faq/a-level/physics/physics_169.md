The phase angle in an alternating current (AC) circuit is determined using trigonometric principles.

In an AC circuit, both voltage and current continuously fluctuate in magnitude and direction. The phase angle represents the difference in phase between the voltage and current waveforms. It is quantified in degrees or radians and indicates the extent to which the current waveform either leads or lags behind the voltage waveform.

To compute the phase angle, we need to establish the phase difference between the voltage and current waveforms. This can be accomplished through trigonometry. We can represent these waveforms as phasors, which are vectors rotating in a circular motion at a constant frequency. The angle formed between the voltage and current phasors corresponds to the phase angle.

One method to calculate the phase angle involves using an oscilloscope to measure the time difference between the voltage and current waveforms. This time difference can then be transformed into an angle using the following formula:

$$
\text{Phase Angle} = \left( \frac{\text{Time Difference}}{\text{Period}} \right) \times 360^\circ
$$

Alternatively, the phase angle can be calculated using complex numbers. In this approach, we represent the voltage and current waveforms as complex numbers and determine the phase angle as the angle between these two complex numbers. This method is generally more precise and is frequently employed in circuit analysis.
