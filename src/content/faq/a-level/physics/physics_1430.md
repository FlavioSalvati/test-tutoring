To determine the uncertainty in the gradient of a graph, we utilize the formula 

$$
\Delta m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}.
$$

The gradient of a graph indicates the rate of change of the dependent variable (usually represented on the y-axis) with respect to the independent variable (typically on the x-axis). The uncertainty in the gradient quantifies how much the gradient might fluctuate due to errors present in the data. To compute this uncertainty, we must first establish the uncertainties associated with the y and x values.

The uncertainty in the y values, denoted as $\Delta y$, can be calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties in each y value:

$$
\Delta y = \sqrt{\sum (\Delta y_i)^2},
$$

where $\Delta y_i$ corresponds to the uncertainty in each individual y value. Likewise, the uncertainty in the x values, denoted as $\Delta x$, is determined in the same manner:

$$
\Delta x = \sqrt{\sum (\Delta x_j)^2,
$$

where $\Delta x_j$ represents the uncertainty in each individual x value.

After we have computed the uncertainties in the y and x values, we can apply the formula 

$$
\Delta m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$ 

to ascertain the uncertainty in the gradient. This calculation provides us with an estimate of the maximum possible variation in the gradient due to the uncertainties in the data.

It's important to emphasize that the uncertainty in the gradient is merely an estimate of the maximum potential error. This estimation presumes that the errors associated with the y and x values are independent, random, and normally distributed. In real-world scenarios, the actual uncertainties may differ from these calculated values, depending on the specific characteristics of the errors present in the data.

**A-Level Physics Tutor Summary:** To calculate the uncertainty in a graph's gradient, we use the formula 

$$
\Delta m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}.
$$ 

First, find $\Delta y$ and $\Delta x$ by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of their individual uncertainties. This method estimates the maximum potential error in the gradient, assuming that the errors are random and follow a normal distribution. Keep in mind that this is only an estimate of the maximum error.
