To determine the mechanical advantage of a simple machine, you can use the following relationship: divide the output force by the input force.

Mechanical advantage quantifies the extent to which a machine can amplify either force or distance. It is defined as the ratio of the output force (the force generated by the machine) to the input force (the force exerted on the machine). The formula for calculating mechanical advantage is:

$$
\text{Mechanical Advantage} = \frac{\text{Output Force}}{\text{Input Force}}
$$

For instance, consider a lever that produces an output force of $100 \, \text{N}$ while requiring an input force of $20 \, \text{N}$. The mechanical advantage of this lever can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Mechanical Advantage} = \frac{100 \, \text{N}}{20 \, \text{N}} = 5
$$

This result indicates that the lever can effectively multiply the input force by a factor of $5$, thereby facilitating the lifting of heavier objects. Generally, a higher mechanical advantage signifies that it is easier to perform work with that machine.

It's important to keep in mind that the mechanical advantage does not account for energy losses due to factors such as friction. Consequently, the actual mechanical advantage experienced in practice may be lower than the theoretical value derived from the formula above.
