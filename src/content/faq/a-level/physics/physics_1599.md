The period and frequency of an alternating current are inversely related.

Alternating current (AC) is a type of electrical current that periodically changes its direction. The period of an AC signal, denoted as $T$, is the time required to complete one full cycle, while the frequency, denoted as $f$, represents the number of cycles that occur in one second. These two quantities are mathematically related by the equation:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$

In this equation, $f$ is measured in Hertz (Hz), which signifies cycles per second, whereas the period $T$ is measured in seconds. Thus, if the frequency of an AC signal is high, the period will be correspondingly low, and vice versa. This inverse relationship indicates that as the frequency increases, the period decreases, and vice versa.

Understanding the relationship between period and frequency is crucial in the analysis of AC circuits. For instance, in circuits containing capacitors or inductors, both the period and frequency can significantly influence the circuit's behavior. Furthermore, these parameters are essential for calculating other characteristics of the AC signal, such as amplitude and phase.

In summary, the period and frequency of an alternating current are inversely proportional. This fundamental relationship is vital for studying AC circuits and can be utilized to derive other important parameters of the AC signal.
