Young's modulus decreases with increasing temperature due to the enhanced thermal vibrations of atoms.

When a material is heated, the thermal energy induces more rapid vibrations among the atoms. This increased atomic motion disrupts the regular arrangement of atoms within the material, making it more susceptible to deformation. Consequently, the material becomes less rigid, leading to a decrease in its Young's modulus.

The impact of temperature on Young's modulus varies across different materials. Generally, metals exhibit a more significant reduction in Young's modulus with rising temperatures compared to polymers and ceramics. This greater sensitivity in metals is attributed to their higher thermal conductivity, which facilitates the efficient distribution of heat throughout the material. For further information on how heat is conducted in various materials, please refer to our accompanying notes.

At elevated temperatures, certain materials may undergo phase transitions, such as melting or crystallization, which can significantly alter their mechanical properties. Therefore, it is crucial to account for the temperature dependence of Young's modulus when designing materials intended for high-temperature applications.
