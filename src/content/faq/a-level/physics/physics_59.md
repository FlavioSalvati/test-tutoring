The power of a rotating machine can be determined using the formula 

$$
P = \tau \omega,
$$ 

where \( P \) represents power, \( \tau \) denotes torque, and \( \omega \) stands for angular velocity.

To effectively calculate the power of a rotating machine, it is crucial to first grasp the concepts of torque and angular velocity. Torque is the force that induces an object to rotate around an axis, while angular velocity is the rate at which that rotation occurs.

The formula for power, \( P = \tau \omega \), integrates these two fundamental concepts. It indicates that the power of a rotating machine is equal to the torque applied to the machine multiplied by the angular velocity at which it rotates.

To compute the torque exerted on a rotating machine, you can use the formula 

$$
\tau = F r,
$$ 

where \( \tau \) is torque, \( F \) is the applied force, and \( r \) is the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied. Once torque is calculated, you can determine angular velocity using the formula 

$$
\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t},
$$ 

where \( \omega \) represents angular velocity, \( \Delta \theta \) is the change in angle over a specified time interval, and \( \Delta t \) is the duration of that interval.

By combining these formulas, you can accurately calculate the power of a rotating machine. It is essential to ensure that the units for torque and angular velocity are consistent—typically, torque is measured in newton-meters (Nm) and angular velocity in radians per second (rad/s)—to ensure that the resulting units for power are correct, with power measured in watts (W).
