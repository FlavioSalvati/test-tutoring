A photovoltaic cell, commonly referred to as a solar cell, is a device that converts sunlight into electrical energy through a process known as the photovoltaic effect.

These cells are primarily constructed from semiconductor materials, with silicon being the most prevalent choice. When sunlight strikes the surface of a photovoltaic cell, it energizes the electrons within the silicon, prompting them to move and generate an electric current. This phenomenon is the essence of the photovoltaic effect.

A typical photovoltaic cell consists of two layers of silicon: one layer carries a positive charge (p-type), while the other layer carries a negative charge (n-type). When sunlight illuminates the cell, it establishes an electric field across the junction of these two layers. This electric field induces the movement of electrons from the n-type layer to the p-type layer, resulting in a flow of electricity that can be harnessed as usable electrical energy.

The efficiency of a photovoltaic cell is influenced by various factors, including the purity and quality of the semiconductor material, the thickness of the cell, and the angle and intensity of the incoming sunlight. Additionally, photovoltaic cells can be interconnected in series or parallel configurations to enhance either the voltage or current output, depending on the energy needs of the application.

Photovoltaic cells are widely utilized in solar panels, which generate electricity for residential and commercial use. As a clean and renewable energy source, they play a crucial role in the transition toward a more sustainable future.
