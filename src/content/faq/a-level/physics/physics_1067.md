The elastic potential energy stored in an object is transformed into other forms of energy when the object is deformed beyond its elastic limit.

When an object is deformed past its elastic limit, it indicates that the object has been either stretched or compressed beyond its capacity to revert to its original shape. At this juncture, the object has reached its plastic limit and will no longer regain its initial form, even if the applied force is removed.

Once the deformation exceeds the elastic limit, the elastic potential energy that was previously stored in the object is converted into various other energy forms. This energy may be dissipated as heat, sound, or even light. For instance, when a metal wire is stretched beyond its elastic limit, it can become warm due to friction between the atoms within the wire.

If the deformation is extreme enough, the object might break or fracture. In such cases, the elastic potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy as the fragments of the object separate and move apart.

In summary, when an object is deformed beyond its elastic limit, the elastic potential energy is converted into other energy types, including heat, sound, or kinetic energy. This transformation occurs because the object has reached its plastic limit and is unable to return to its original shape.
