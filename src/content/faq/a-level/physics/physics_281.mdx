The principle of apparent depth describes how an object's perceived depth can differ from its actual depth when observed through a medium, such as water or glass.

When light transitions from one medium to another, it undergoes a change in direction, a phenomenon known as refraction. The degree of refraction is influenced by the angle of incidence, which is the angle between the incoming light ray and the normal line perpendicular to the surface of the medium. Generally, a larger angle of incidence results in a greater degree of refraction.

As light rays from an object pass through a medium, they are refracted, which alters the perceived position of the object. This results in the object appearing at a shallower depth than its true location. The apparent depth is defined as the depth at which the object seems to be located.

The principle of apparent depth has various practical applications. For instance, in the design of swimming pools, sloping the sides can enhance the apparent depth of the water, making it seem deeper than its actual measurement. This design choice not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of the pool but also contributes to safety by giving swimmers the impression that the water is deeper.

In summary, the principle of apparent depth is a significant concept in physics that elucidates why objects can appear to be at different depths when viewed through a medium. This principle is widely applicable across numerous fields, including optics, engineering, and architecture.
