Electromagnetism is a fundamental branch of physics that explores the interactions between electrically charged particles. This force governs the behavior of these particles, leading to phenomena such as attraction and repulsion, the generation of electric and magnetic fields, and the propagation of electromagnetic waves. The interaction of electromagnetism is mediated by photons, which are particles of light.

Electricity and magnetism are deeply interconnected; they represent different facets of the same fundamental force. For instance, when an electric current flows through a wire, it generates a magnetic field around that wire. Conversely, a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current in a nearby wire.

Electromagnetism plays a crucial role in numerous technological applications, including electric motors, generators, transformers, and telecommunications. Additionally, it forms the basis of our understanding of light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, which are utilized in areas such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and various other fields.

The principles of electromagnetism are encapsulated in Maxwell's equations, a set of four equations that connect electric and magnetic fields to their sourcesâ€”namely electric charges and currents. These equations have been rigorously tested and confirmed to an extraordinary degree of precision, making them one of the foundational cornerstones of modern physics.
