To calculate the electric field generated by a charged plane, we can use the formula:

$$
E = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0},
$$

where $\sigma$ represents the surface charge density and $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

A charged plane is characterized as a flat surface with a uniform distribution of charge. To determine the electric field at a specific point near the plane, it is essential to consider the contributions from all the charges present on the plane. Since the electric field is a vector quantity, we must ascertain both its direction and magnitude.

This formula for the electric field assumes that the plane is infinite in extent and maintains a uniform charge density $\sigma$. If the plane is finite, we must account for its size, shape, and the specific distribution of charge along its surface.

To apply this formula, we need to know the value of $\sigma$, which indicates the charge per unit area of the plane. Additionally, we must be aware of the value of $\varepsilon_0$, a fundamental constant in physics. The electric field is directly proportional to the charge density $\sigma$; thus, an increase in the charge density will result in a corresponding increase in the electric field strength.

The direction of the electric field produced by a charged plane is always perpendicular to the surface of the plane. It points away from the positively charged side and towards the negatively charged side, following the principle that electric field lines originate from positive charges and terminate at negative charges.
