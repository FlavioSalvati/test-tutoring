Isotopes are atoms of the same element that possess identical numbers of protons in their nuclei but differ in the number of neutrons. This distinction results in isotopes having the same atomic number while exhibiting varying mass numbers. For instance, the isotopes of carbon—carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14—are characterized as follows: carbon-12 contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons, carbon-13 has 6 protons and 7 neutrons, and carbon-14 comprises 6 protons and 8 neutrons.

The differing masses of isotopes can lead to variations in their physical and chemical properties. For example, carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope commonly utilized in carbon dating, a method that helps determine the age of fossils and archaeological artifacts. In contrast, carbon-13 finds application in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which is instrumental in studying the structures of organic molecules.

Isotopes also play significant roles in the medical field, both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Radioactive isotopes, such as iodine and technetium, are employed in medical imaging to identify and manage thyroid and bone diseases. Additionally, isotopes like cobalt and cesium are utilized in radiation therapy for cancer treatment.

In conclusion, isotopes are variants of the same element that differ in their neutron count within the nucleus. These differences result in unique physical and chemical properties, allowing for a diverse range of applications in both scientific research and medical practice.
