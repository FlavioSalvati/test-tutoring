The Compton effect refers to the scattering of X-rays by electrons, serving as a compelling illustration of the wave-particle duality inherent in quantum theory.

Discovered by Arthur Compton in 1923, the Compton effect provides significant evidence supporting the wave-particle duality concept. This phenomenon can be understood by considering X-rays as particles and electrons as entities that exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties.

When an X-ray photon collides with an electron, it transfers a portion of its energy to the electron, resulting in the electron's recoil. Consequently, the scattered X-ray photon emerges with a longer wavelength and lower energy compared to the original incident photon. This alteration in wavelength is referred to as the Compton shift, which is directly proportional to the angle at which the scattering occurs.

The Compton effect reinforces quantum theory by demonstrating that X-rays exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. In this context, the incoming X-ray photon is treated as a particle, while the scattered photon is conceptualized as a wave. Similarly, the electron acts as both a particle and a wave as it recoils from the collision, potentially generating a diffraction pattern.

In summary, the Compton effect serves as a crucial demonstration of the wave-particle duality in quantum theory. It provides robust evidence for the notion that particles can exhibit wave-like behavior and vice versa, thereby enhancing our understanding of the behavior of subatomic particles within a quantum mechanical framework.
