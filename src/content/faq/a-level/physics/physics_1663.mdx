A cyclotron is a device that accelerates charged particles by utilizing a combination of magnetic and electric fields.

The cyclotron features two hollow, semi-circular electrodes, referred to as "dees," which are positioned within a strong magnetic field. These dees are connected to a high-frequency alternating voltage source, generating an oscillating electric field between them. Charged particles are injected at the center of the cyclotron and are initially accelerated by this electric field between the dees.

As the particles travel towards the edges of the dees, they encounter a perpendicular magnetic field that directs them along a circular trajectory. The magnetic field is carefully calibrated so that the particles complete a full circular path and return to the gap between the dees precisely when the electric field reverses direction. This synchronization allows for continuous acceleration of the particles with each cycle.

The frequency of the alternating voltage is fine-tuned to ensure that the particles accumulate energy in each cycle until they reach the desired energy level. Once the particles achieve this target energy, they are extracted from the cyclotron for various applications, including medical imaging and cancer treatment.

In summary, the cyclotron is an effective and efficient mechanism for accelerating particles to high energies, leveraging the principles of magnetic and electric fields.
