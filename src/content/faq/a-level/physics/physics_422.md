Nuclear reactors produce electricity by harnessing the energy released during nuclear fission reactions.

The operation of a nuclear reactor relies on a controlled nuclear fission chain reaction to generate heat, which is subsequently converted into electricity. Inside the reactor core, fuel rods composed of enriched uranium are present. When these uranium atoms are struck by neutrons, they undergo fission, releasing a substantial amount of energy in the form of heat. This heat is then transferred to a coolant, typically water, that circulates through the reactor core.

The heated coolant moves to a heat exchanger, where it transfers its heat to a secondary coolant, which is then used to produce steam. This steam drives a turbine connected to a generator, which ultimately produces electricity. After passing through the turbine, the secondary coolant is cooled and returned to the heat exchanger, allowing the cycle to repeat.

The reactor's fission process is precisely controlled by inserting or removing control rods made from materials such as boron or cadmium. These control rods absorb neutrons and can slow down or halt the chain reaction as needed. Additionally, nuclear reactors are equipped with various safety features, including emergency cooling systems, to mitigate the risk of overheating and potential meltdowns.

While nuclear reactors serve as a dependable source of low-carbon electricity, they also present certain risks, particularly the possibility of releasing radioactive materials in the event of an accident. Therefore, their operation necessitates stringent regulation and robust safety measures.
