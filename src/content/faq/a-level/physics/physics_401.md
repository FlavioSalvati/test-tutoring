Wave dispersion refers to the phenomenon in which waves of varying frequencies propagate at different speeds.

When a wave travels through a medium, its speed is influenced by the medium's properties, such as density and elasticity. However, in the case of waves composed of multiple frequencies, each frequency component interacts with the medium in a distinct manner. This variation in interaction results in different propagation speeds for each frequency, causing the wave to spread out, or disperse, over time.

A well-known example of wave dispersion is the separation of light into its constituent colors when it passes through a prism. This occurs because different colors of light correspond to different frequencies, and consequently, they travel at different speeds through the prism.

Another illustrative example can be found in ocean waves, where longer wavelength waves travel faster than their shorter wavelength counterparts. This disparity in speed leads to the waves breaking at different points along the shoreline, contributing to the formation of surf zones.

Wave dispersion is a critical concept across various fields of physics, including optics, acoustics, and seismology. By gaining a deeper understanding of how waves disperse, scientists can enhance their ability to predict and control wave behavior in a range of applications.
