Accretion is the fundamental process through which particles aggregate to form larger celestial bodies during the formation of solar systems.

In the initial stages of solar system formation, a cloud of gas and dust begins to collapse under its own gravitational pull. As this cloud contracts, it starts to spin, leading to the formation of a protoplanetary disk. Within this disk, particles collide and adhere to one another, gradually building up larger structures known as planetesimals. These planetesimals continue to collide and coalesce, ultimately resulting in the formation of planets.

Accretion occurs primarily through two mechanisms: collisional and gravitational. In collisional accretion, particles stick together upon collision, primarily due to electrostatic forces. Conversely, gravitational accretion involves particles being attracted to one another through their mutual gravitational forces.

The rate of accretion is influenced by several factors, including the size and density of the particles, the temperature and pressure within the disk, and the distance from the central star. Additionally, the presence of large gas giants can disrupt the accretion process; these massive bodies may scatter smaller particles, hindering their ability to coalesce into larger planetary structures.

In summary, accretion is a vital process in the formation of solar systems, enabling the aggregation of small particles into the planets and other celestial bodies that constitute our solar system today.
