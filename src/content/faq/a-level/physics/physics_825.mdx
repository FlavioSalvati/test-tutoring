Radiation detection and measurement involve the use of specialized instruments designed to identify and quantify the amount of radiation present in a given environment.

Several types of instruments are employed for this purpose, including Geiger-Muller counters, scintillation detectors, and ionization chambers. Each of these devices operates on the principle of detecting ionizing radiation emitted by radioactive materials.

**Geiger-Muller Counters**: These devices utilize a gas-filled tube that generates an electrical pulse when ionizing radiation passes through it. The frequency of these pulses is directly proportional to the intensity of the radiation detected.

**Scintillation Detectors**: These instruments consist of a crystal that emits light when ionizing radiation interacts with it. The intensity of the emitted light correlates with the amount of radiation present.

**Ionization Chambers**: These chambers are filled with gas and produce an electrical current when ionizing radiation passes through them. Similar to the other detectors, the magnitude of the current generated is directly proportional to the radiation levels.

Once radiation is detected, it is quantified using specific units such as the Becquerel ($Bq$) and the Gray ($Gy$). The Becquerel measures the rate of radioactive decay per second, while the Gray quantifies the amount of energy absorbed per kilogram of material.

Radiation detection and measurement play a crucial role in various fields, including nuclear power, medicine, and environmental monitoring. These practices are essential for ensuring that radiation levels remain safe and within established regulatory limits.
