The effect of frequency on resonance is that it significantly increases the amplitude of oscillation.

Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when an external force is applied to a system at its natural frequency. When the frequency of the external force coincides with the system's natural frequency, the amplitude of oscillation increases dramatically. This occurs because the energy transferred to the system is stored as potential energy, which is then converted into kinetic energy, resulting in larger oscillations.

The relationship between frequency and resonance can be expressed mathematically with the equation:

$$
f = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}},
$$

where $f$ represents the natural frequency of the system, $k$ is the spring constant, and $m$ is the mass of the system. This equation illustrates that the natural frequency is directly proportional to the square root of the spring constant and inversely proportional to the square root of the mass.

In practical applications, the effect of frequency on resonance can be observed in various systems, such as musical instruments, bridges, and buildings. For instance, when a musician plays a note on a guitar string, the string vibrates at its natural frequency, generating sound waves that resonate within the guitar's body, thus amplifying the sound. Similarly, when wind flows across a bridge, it can induce resonance at the bridge's natural frequency, causing vibrations that may lead to structural damage.

In summary, the effect of frequency on resonance leads to an increase in the amplitude of oscillation, which can have significant implications for various systems.
