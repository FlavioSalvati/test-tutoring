Binary stars are systems in which two stars orbit around a shared center of mass due to their mutual gravitational attraction. The gravitational force between these stars causes them to revolve around each other, with the center of mass often located closer to the more massive star. This shift occurs because the more massive star exerts a stronger gravitational pull, resulting in an offset center of mass.

The orbits of binary stars can take on circular or elliptical shapes, depending on the initial conditions of the system. The orbital period is influenced by the masses of the stars and the distance between them; specifically, the closer the stars are to one another, the faster they will orbit around their common center of mass.

In addition to their orbital motion, binary stars can exhibit different types of movement, such as radial velocity and proper motion. Radial velocity refers to the motion of the stars moving towards or away from Earth, while proper motion describes the stars' movement across the celestial sphere. Observing these motions can provide crucial data for determining the masses and distances of the stars within a binary system.

In summary, the orbits of binary stars represent a complex interplay of gravitational forces and motion. Studying these binary systems yields valuable insights into stellar properties and behavior, as well as the fundamental principles of physics.
