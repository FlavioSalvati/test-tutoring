To analyze a direct current (DC) circuit using mesh analysis, follow these systematic steps.

Mesh analysis is a method employed to evaluate DC circuits by dividing the circuit into distinct loops, known as meshes. The initial step involves identifying these meshes within the circuit. A mesh is defined as a loop that does not enclose any other loops. Once the meshes are identified, assign a current variable to each mesh. The direction of the current can be chosen arbitrarily, but it must remain consistent throughout the analysis.

Next, you will need to formulate Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) equations for each mesh. KVL states that the sum of the voltage drops around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero. The voltage drop across a resistor can be calculated as the product of its resistance, denoted as $R$, and the current flowing through it, denoted as $I$. Utilize Ohm's Law, expressed as $V = RI$, to express the voltage drop in terms of the current variable assigned to each mesh.

After constructing the KVL equations, solve them simultaneously to determine the values of the mesh currents. Once the mesh currents are established, you can calculate the current flowing through each resistor using Ohm's Law. Additionally, the voltage drop across each resistor can be computed by multiplying its resistance by the current flowing through it.

In summary, mesh analysis serves as a powerful technique for analyzing DC circuits. It involves dividing the circuit into meshes, assigning current variables to each mesh, writing KVL equations for each mesh, and solving these equations simultaneously to find the mesh currents.
