Energy is generated in a nuclear power plant through the process of nuclear fission.

Within the nuclear reactor, uranium atoms undergo splitting in a reaction known as nuclear fission. This process releases an immense amount of energy in the form of heat. The heat produced is then utilized to generate steam, which drives a turbine connected to a generator. The generator subsequently converts the kinetic energy of the turbine into electrical energy.

Control of the nuclear fission process is achieved using control rods, which absorb neutrons and slow down the reaction. This regulation allows the reactor to maintain a steady operational rate and prevents overheating.

Once the fuel rods have been depleted and can no longer produce sufficient energy, they are removed and stored in a cooling pool. These spent fuel rods are highly radioactive and must be securely stored for thousands of years to ensure safety.

Nuclear power plants are often viewed with controversy due to concerns regarding safety and the management of radioactive waste. Nevertheless, they serve as a reliable and efficient energy source, capable of producing substantial amounts of electricity without generating greenhouse gas emissions. As technological advancements continue, new solutions may emerge to tackle the challenges associated with nuclear power, enhancing its viability as a sustainable energy source.
