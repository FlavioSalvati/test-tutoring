Carbon dating, also referred to as radiocarbon dating, is a technique used to ascertain the age of organic materials by measuring the quantity of carbon-14 present in a sample. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that is naturally produced in the atmosphere and subsequently absorbed by plants during the process of photosynthesis. When an organism dies, it ceases to absorb carbon-14, and the isotopic concentration within its body begins to decay at a known rate.

To conduct carbon dating, a small sample of the material in question is collected and treated with chemicals to eliminate any contaminants. The remaining carbon is then converted into carbon dioxide gas and analyzed using a mass spectrometer. The measured amount of carbon-14 in the sample is compared to the expected level of carbon-14 in a living organism of the same age. This comparison allows scientists to calculate the age of the sample based on the difference in carbon-14 levels.

Carbon dating is particularly effective for dating materials that are less than $50,000$ years old, as the concentration of carbon-14 in older materials becomes too diminished for accurate measurement. It is important to note that carbon dating is applicable only to organic materials, as inorganic substances do not contain carbon-14. Despite these limitations, carbon dating has proven to be a vital tool in estimating the age of archaeological and geological specimens, significantly contributing to our understanding of the Earth's history and the evolution of its inhabitants.
