Particles are detected in a cloud chamber by leaving a visible trail as they ionize the surrounding gas molecules.

A cloud chamber is an instrument designed to detect and track charged particles, such as electrons and alpha particles. It contains a supersaturated vapor of a liquid, typically alcohol or water. When a charged particle traverses the chamber, it ionizes the gas molecules along its path. This ionization leads to the condensation of gas molecules into tiny droplets, which form a visible trail that can be photographed or observed directly.

The cloud chamber is often situated within a magnetic field, which causes charged particles to follow a curved trajectory. By measuring the curvature of this path, one can deduce the particle's charge and momentum. Additionally, the cloud chamber can be utilized to identify various types of particles based on their unique patterns of ionization and curvature.

Cloud chambers were initially developed in the early 20th century and played a crucial role in the discovery of several subatomic particles, including the positron and the muon. Although modern physics research has largely transitioned to newer detection methods, such as particle accelerators, cloud chambers continue to serve as valuable tools for educational purposes and outreach activities.
