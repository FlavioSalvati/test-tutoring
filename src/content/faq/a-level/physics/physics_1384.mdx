A switching power supply is a device that transforms alternating current (AC) voltage into direct current (DC) voltage through high-frequency switching techniques.

The process begins by rectifying the AC voltage into a high-voltage DC voltage. This DC voltage is then fed into a high-frequency oscillator, which alternately switches the voltage on and off at a rapid rate. The resulting waveform is a square wave, where the duty cycle of the wave dictates the average output voltage. Following this, the waveform is filtered to eliminate the high-frequency components, resulting in the desired, smooth DC voltage.

The use of high-frequency switching enables the implementation of smaller and lighter components within the power supply, enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Typically, the switching frequency ranges from tens to hundreds of kilohertz.

Switching power supplies can be designed as either step-up (boost) or step-down (buck) converters. A step-up converter increases the output voltage, whereas a step-down converter reduces it. Both types utilize inductors and capacitors to store and release energy, facilitating efficient voltage conversion.

In summary, switching power supplies are widely favored in electronic devices due to their efficiency, compact size, and affordability.
