The principle of conservation of energy is fundamental in the study of particle interactions, stating that energy cannot be created or destroyed.

In any particle interaction, the total energy of the system must remain constant before and after the interaction. This implies that the energy of all particles involved must be conserved. For instance, in a collision between two particles, the total kinetic energy prior to the collision must equal the total kinetic energy following the collision. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}.
$$

The conservation of energy serves as a crucial tool for predicting the outcomes of particle interactions. Knowing the initial energy of a particle allows physicists to calculate its final energy after it has interacted with another particle. 

Furthermore, in certain particle interactions, energy may transform from one form to another. For example, during particle decay, the energy of the decaying particle is converted into the energy of the resulting decay products. Nevertheless, the overall energy of the system remains conserved, satisfying the conservation law.

In summary, the conservation of energy is a foundational principle in the realm of particle interactions. It guarantees that energy is always conserved, thus enabling physicists to accurately predict the outcomes of these interactions.
