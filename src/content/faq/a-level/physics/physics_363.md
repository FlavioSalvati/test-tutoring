Radioactive decay is a process in which an unstable atomic nucleus emits radiation, thereby transforming into a more stable configuration.

This decay is spontaneous and occurs in atomic nuclei that are unstable, often due to an imbalance in the ratio of neutrons to protons. Several types of radiation can be emitted during this decay process, which include alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays.

**Alpha Decay**: In alpha decay, an unstable nucleus emits an alpha particle. An alpha particle is essentially a helium nucleus, composed of two protons and two neutrons. This emission results in a decrease of the atomic number by $2$ and a reduction of the mass number by $4$.

**Beta Decay**: Beta decay involves the emission of a beta particle, which can be either an electron or a positron. There are two types of beta decay:
- **Beta Minus Decay**: In this type, a neutron in the nucleus transforms into a proton, releasing an electron and an antineutrino in the process.
- **Beta Plus Decay**: Conversely, in beta plus decay, a proton is converted into a neutron, leading to the emission of a positron and a neutrino.

**Gamma Decay**: Gamma decay occurs when an unstable nucleus releases energy in the form of gamma rays, which are high-energy photons. Importantly, gamma decay does not alter the atomic number or mass number of the nucleus.

The rate at which radioactive decay occurs is quantified by the concept of half-life. The half-life is defined as the time required for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay. This property is unique to each radioactive isotope and can vary significantly, ranging from fractions of a second to billions of years. 

Radioactive decay is not only a fundamental concept in nuclear physics but also plays a crucial role in various applications, including nuclear power generation, medical imaging techniques, and the process of carbon dating.
