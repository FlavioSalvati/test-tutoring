Plastic deformation is characterized by its permanence, while elastic deformation is reversible.

When a material is subjected to stress, it can experience two primary types of deformation: plastic and elastic. Elastic deformation is temporary; it allows the material to return to its original shape once the applied stress is removed. This recovery occurs as long as the stress remains within the material's elastic limitâ€”the maximum stress it can endure without undergoing permanent deformation. For a more comprehensive exploration of material behavior under force, refer to the relevant section on material properties.

In contrast, plastic deformation is permanent and irreversible. This type of deformation occurs when the applied stress surpasses the elastic limit, leading to lasting changes in the material's shape. Once the stress is removed, the material will not revert to its original form. To gain further insights into how materials behave under stress, consult the notes on material properties.

Understanding the distinction between plastic and elastic deformation is crucial in engineering and materials science. Materials designed for plastic deformation, such as metals utilized in construction, must be engineered to endure the stresses they will encounter without failing. Conversely, materials intended for elastic deformation, like springs, should be designed to return to their initial shape after the application of stress.
