The force experienced by a charged particle in a magnetic field can be calculated using the formula 

$$
F = Bqv,
$$

where:

- $F$ is the force,
- $B$ is the magnetic field strength,
- $q$ is the charge of the particle, and
- $v$ is the velocity of the particle.

When a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force that is perpendicular to both its direction of motion and the direction of the magnetic field. This phenomenon is referred to as the Lorentz force. 

To determine the direction of this force, you can use the right-hand rule. Point your thumb in the direction of the particle's velocity and your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field; the force will then be directed outwards from your palm, perpendicular to both.

It is crucial to understand that the force acting on a charged particle in a magnetic field does not alter its speed; it only changes the direction of the particle's motion. This occurs because the force is always perpendicular to the particle's velocity.

The magnitude of the Lorentz force can be increased by enhancing any of the following factors: the strength of the magnetic field $B$, the charge of the particle $q$, or the velocity of the particle $v$. This principle is applied in various technologies, including particle accelerators and magnetic confinement fusion reactors.
