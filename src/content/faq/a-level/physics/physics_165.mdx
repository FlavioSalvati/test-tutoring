The Coriolis force arises from the rotation of the Earth, influencing the movement of objects on its surface.

This fictitious force acts on moving objects due to the Earth's rotation and is named after the French mathematician Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis, who first described it in 1835. The Coriolis force is always perpendicular to both the direction of motion and the axis of rotation. As a result, objects in the Northern Hemisphere are deflected to the right, while those in the Southern Hemisphere are deflected to the left.

The origin of the Coriolis force lies in the differential rotational speed of various parts of the Earth. Because different latitudes rotate at different speeds, objects traveling across the Earth's surface do not follow a straight path; instead, they trace a curved trajectory. The strength of the Coriolis force is greatest at the poles, where the rotational speed is highest, and weakest at the equator, where the rotational speed is lowest.

This force plays a crucial role in shaping weather patterns, ocean currents, and the flight paths of aircraft. Additionally, it is vital in the design of large structures, such as skyscrapers and bridges, which must be engineered to withstand the effects of the Earth's rotation. Consequently, a thorough understanding of the Coriolis force is essential in various fields of physics and engineering.
