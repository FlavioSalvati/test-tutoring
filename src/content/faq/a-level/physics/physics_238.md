The energy stored in a compressed spring is a form of potential energy that can be transformed into kinetic energy.

When a spring is compressed, work is performed on it to accumulate potential energy. This potential energy manifests as elastic potential energy, which is the energy retained in an object when it is either stretched or compressed. The quantity of potential energy stored in a spring is directly proportional to the degree of compression or stretching applied to it. This relationship is articulated by Hooke's Law, which asserts that the force needed to compress or extend a spring is directly proportional to the extent of that compression or extension.

The formula for calculating the potential energy stored in a compressed spring is expressed as:

$$
PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

In this equation, $PE$ represents the potential energy, $k$ denotes the spring constant, and $x$ signifies the amount of compression or stretching applied.

When the spring is released, the potential energy stored in it can be converted into kinetic energy. As the spring returns to its original shape, the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy, which results in the motion of the spring. The kinetic energy generated during this process is equal to the amount of potential energy that was initially stored in the spring.

In summary, the energy stored in a compressed spring is a type of potential energy that is convertible into kinetic energy. This potential energy is classified as elastic potential energy, and its magnitude is proportional to the extent of compression or stretching experienced by the spring.
