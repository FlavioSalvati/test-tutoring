Potential energy is directly proportional to both mass and height, as described by the equation 

$$
PE = mgh
$$

where \( PE \) represents potential energy, \( m \) is the mass of the object, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height above a reference level.

Potential energy is the energy an object possesses because of its position or configuration in a gravitational field. It is a scalar quantity measured in joules (J). The potential energy of an object increases with both its mass and its height relative to the reference level. 

The mass of an object quantifies the amount of matter it contains. As the mass increases, so does the potential energy. This is due to the fact that a heavier object requires more energy to elevate it to a specific height, resulting in higher potential energy when it reaches that elevation.

Similarly, the height of an object above the reference level plays a crucial role in determining its potential energy. The higher the object is positioned, the greater its potential energy becomes. This is attributable to the fact that the gravitational force acting on the object increases with height, necessitating more work to lift it to a greater altitude. Consequently, an object situated at a higher elevation possesses more potential energy.

In summary, potential energy is directly proportional to both mass and height. The larger the mass and height of an object, the greater its potential energy, as expressed by the formula 

$$
PE = mgh
$$
