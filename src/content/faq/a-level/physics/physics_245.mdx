Work done on an object is directly proportional to both the force applied and the displacement of that object.

When a force is exerted on an object, and the object moves in the direction of that force, we say that work has been performed on the object. The relationship between work, force, and displacement can be mathematically represented by the equation:

$$
W = F \cdot d
$$

In this equation, $W$ represents the work done, $F$ denotes the force applied, and $d$ indicates the displacement of the object.

The unit of work is the joule (J), which is defined as the amount of work done when a force of one newton (N) is applied to move an object over a distance of one meter (m). For example, if a force of $10 \, \text{N}$ is applied to an object, causing it to move a distance of $5 \, \text{m}$ in the direction of the force, the work done on the object can be calculated as follows:

$$
W = 10 \, \text{N} \cdot 5 \, \text{m} = 50 \, \text{J}
$$

It is crucial to understand that work is only performed when the force is applied in the same direction as the displacement of the object. If the force acts at an angle to the direction of displacement, only the component of the force that aligns with the displacement does work. This concept is quantified using the dot product of force and displacement.

In summary, the work done on an object is directly proportional to both the applied force and the displacement. This proportionality is encapsulated in the equation:

$$
W = F \cdot d
$$

The standard unit of work is the joule (J).
