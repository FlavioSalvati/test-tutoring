An infrared sensor is a device that detects infrared radiation emitted by objects and converts this radiation into an electrical signal.

Infrared sensors operate by identifying infrared radiation, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation characterized by longer wavelengths than visible light. When an object emits infrared radiation, the sensor captures this radiation and transforms it into an electrical signal that can be processed by a microcontroller or other electronic devices.

There are two primary types of infrared sensors: passive and active. 

- **Passive Infrared Sensors**: These sensors detect the natural infrared radiation emitted by objects. They are widely utilized in motion detectors and security systems, where they sense the presence of people or animals by detecting their body heat.

- **Active Infrared Sensors**: In contrast, active infrared sensors emit their own infrared radiation and then measure either the reflection or absorption of that radiation by surrounding objects. These sensors are commonly employed in applications such as distance measurement, where they emit a beam of infrared radiation and calculate the time it takes for the beam to return after being reflected.

Infrared sensors have a vast array of applications, ranging from industrial automation to medical devices. They are particularly advantageous in environments where other types of sensors may struggle, such as low-light conditions or in the presence of smoke or dust.
