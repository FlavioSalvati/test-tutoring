The impedance of capacitive and inductive circuits is significantly influenced by the frequency of the alternating current (AC) flowing through them.

In capacitive circuits, the impedance decreases as the frequency increases. This behavior occurs because, at higher frequencies, the capacitor has less time to charge and discharge, leading to reduced opposition to the flow of current. Conversely, at lower frequencies, the capacitor has more time to charge and discharge, resulting in increased opposition to current flow.

In contrast, inductive circuits exhibit an increase in impedance as the frequency rises. This is due to the fact that at higher frequencies, the inductor has less time to establish its magnetic field, which results in decreased opposition to current flow. At lower frequencies, the inductor has more time to build up its magnetic field, thus providing greater opposition to the flow of current.

The mathematical relationship between frequency and impedance in these circuits can be expressed using the following equations: 

For capacitive circuits, the impedance $Z$ is given by:

$$
Z = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
$$

For inductive circuits, the impedance $Z$ is described by:

$$
Z = 2\pi f L
$$

where:
- $Z$ is the impedance,
- $f$ is the frequency,
- $C$ is the capacitance, and
- $L$ is the inductance.

Understanding the interplay between frequency and impedance is crucial for the design and analysis of electrical circuits, especially in AC applications where frequency can vary significantly. This knowledge is also essential in various practical fields, including power transmission and signal processing.
