To determine the force acting on a moving charged particle in a magnetic field, we utilize the equation:

$$
F = Bqv \sin \theta
$$

where:

- $F$ is the force,
- $B$ is the magnetic field strength,
- $q$ is the charge of the particle,
- $v$ is the velocity of the particle, and
- $\theta$ is the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector.

When a charged particle traverses a magnetic field, it experiences a force that is perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. This force is referred to as the Lorentz force.

To ascertain the direction of this force, one can employ the right-hand rule. By extending the thumb of the right hand in the direction of the velocity vector and curling the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field vector, the palm will then indicate the direction of the Lorentz force.

It is crucial to understand that the force exerted on a charged particle in a magnetic field does not alter the particle's speed; it only changes its direction of motion. This occurs because the Lorentz force is always perpendicular to the velocity vector, meaning it does not affect the magnitude of the particle's velocity.

The concept of the Lorentz force is fundamental in the field of electromagnetism and has numerous practical applications, including in particle accelerators and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines.
