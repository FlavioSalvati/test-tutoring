Wave diffraction refers to the bending of waves as they encounter obstacles or pass through openings.

When a wave meets an obstacle or a slit, it has two possible behaviors: it can either pass through the opening or bend around the obstacle. The extent of this bending is influenced by the relationship between the wavelength of the wave and the dimensions of the obstacle or opening. Specifically, if the obstacle or opening is significantly larger than the wavelength, the wave will typically pass through with minimal bending. Conversely, if the size of the obstacle or opening is comparable to the wavelength, the wave will exhibit noticeable bending.

Diffraction is a phenomenon observable in various types of waves, including sound waves, water waves, and electromagnetic waves. For instance, when sound waves encounter a doorway, they can diffract around its edges, allowing the sound to spread into the adjacent room. Similarly, when light waves pass through a narrow slit, they can diffract, resulting in a pattern of alternating bright and dark bands on a screen positioned behind the slit.

The concept of diffraction plays a crucial role in multiple fields of physics, such as optics, acoustics, and radio communication. It is instrumental in the creation of diffraction gratings, which are devices used to separate light into its constituent colors. Additionally, diffraction can focus sound waves in specific directions and lead to the formation of interference patterns. These patterns serve as valuable tools for studying wave properties and the fundamental nature of matter.
