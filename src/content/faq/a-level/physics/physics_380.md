The velocity of a charged particle significantly influences its trajectory when it moves through a magnetic field.

When a charged particle traverses a magnetic field, it experiences a force that is perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. This force is known as the Lorentz force, which can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\mathbf{F} = q (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}),
$$

where $q$ represents the charge of the particle, $\mathbf{v}$ is its velocity vector, and $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field vector. The direction of this force can be determined using the right-hand rule: point your thumb in the direction of the velocity, your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, and your palm will face the direction of the Lorentz force.

The magnitude of the Lorentz force is dependent on the particle's velocity. When the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the force reaches its maximum value, causing the particle to follow a circular path. Conversely, if the velocity is parallel to the magnetic field, no force acts on the particle, and it continues its motion in a straight line. If the velocity is at an angle relative to the magnetic field, the force takes on an intermediate value, resulting in a helical trajectory.

The radius of the circular path that the particle follows is given by the equation:

$$
r = \frac{mv}{qB},
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the particle. This relationship indicates that the radius of the circular path is directly proportional to the particle's velocity. Consequently, a higher velocity corresponds to a larger radius, while a lower velocity results in a smaller radius.

In summary, the velocity of a charged particle plays a crucial role in determining its path within a magnetic field. It influences both the magnitude and direction of the Lorentz force, which ultimately shapes the trajectory of the particle.
