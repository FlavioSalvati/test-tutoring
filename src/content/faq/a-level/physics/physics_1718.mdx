To assess the uncertainty in a single measurement, it is essential to consider the precision of the measuring instrument used.

Uncertainty in a single measurement refers to the range of values within which the true value of the quantity being measured is expected to fall. The precision of the measuring instrument directly influences this uncertainty. Specifically, the smaller the smallest division on the measuring instrument, the more precise the measurement will be, resulting in a smaller associated uncertainty.

To estimate the uncertainty in a single measurement, one can evaluate the smallest division on the measuring instrument and then divide that value by two. For instance, if the smallest division on a ruler is $1 \text{ mm}$, the uncertainty associated with a measurement taken with that ruler would be $0.5 \text{ mm}$.

It is crucial to distinguish between the uncertainty in a single measurement and the uncertainty associated with a set of measurements. To calculate the uncertainty of a series of measurements, one must compute the standard deviation of those measurements.

In summary, to determine the uncertainty in a single measurement, it is important to consider the precision of the measuring instrument. A smaller smallest division on the instrument leads to a more precise measurement and, consequently, a smaller uncertainty.
