Wave reflection refers to the phenomenon where a wave bounces back after encountering a boundary.

When a wave reaches a boundary, it can either be absorbed by the material or reflected back into the original medium. Reflection specifically occurs when the wave travels back in the opposite direction to its initial path. According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence (the angle at which the wave strikes the boundary) is equal to the angle of reflection (the angle at which the wave rebounds).

The extent of reflection is influenced by the characteristics of the boundary. For example, a smooth and flat surface, such as a mirror, will reflect most of the incoming wave. In contrast, a rough or uneven surface, like a rocky shoreline, will scatter some of the wave in various directions, resulting in only a portion of the wave being reflected back.

Wave reflection can be observed in numerous everyday scenarios. For instance, sound waves bouncing off the walls of a room or light waves reflecting off a mirror are common examples. This phenomenon plays a crucial role in various fields such as acoustics, where it helps manage sound in concert halls and recording studios, and optics, where it is essential for the design of mirrors and lenses.
