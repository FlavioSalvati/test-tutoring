Elements that are heavier than iron are created in stars through a process known as supernova nucleosynthesis.

When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it experiences a dramatic explosion called a supernova. During this event, the temperatures and pressures within the star reach extraordinarily high levels, enabling the fusion of heavier elements. This process is referred to as supernova nucleosynthesis.

In the course of supernova nucleosynthesis, neutrons are rapidly incorporated into atomic nuclei, which causes these nuclei to become unstable and subsequently decay. This decay process releases energy and generates new elements. The formation of the heaviest elements, such as gold and platinum, necessitates the addition of a substantial number of neutrons to the atomic nucleusâ€”something that can only happen under the extreme conditions present during a supernova.

Once these newly created elements are formed, they are expelled into space, where they can eventually contribute to the formation of new stars and their associated planetary systems. This process of stellar nucleosynthesis is responsible for generating all elements heavier than helium in the universe.

In summary, elements heavier than iron are synthesized in stars through supernova nucleosynthesis, which occurs during the explosive event of a supernova. During this process, neutrons are rapidly added to atomic nuclei, resulting in the creation of new elements. These elements are then dispersed into space, where they can become part of new stars and their planets.
