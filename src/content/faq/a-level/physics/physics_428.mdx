X-ray techniques encompass a variety of methods, including radiography, computed tomography (CT), and X-ray diffraction.

**Radiography** is the most prevalent X-ray technique. It involves the transmission of X-rays through an object to generate an image on a film or digital detector. This method is extensively utilized in medicine for diagnosing conditions such as bone fractures, dental issues, and other medical ailments.

**Computed Tomography (CT)** is another important X-ray technique that creates detailed images of the internal structures of an object or the human body. CT scans employ X-rays in conjunction with advanced computer processing to produce cross-sectional images. This technique is particularly valuable in medicine for diagnosing internal injuries and diseases.

**X-ray Diffraction** is a specialized technique used to investigate the structure of materials at the atomic or molecular scale. It works by directing X-rays onto a crystal and analyzing the resulting diffraction pattern. X-ray diffraction is widely applied in fields such as materials science, chemistry, and biology to explore the structure of molecules, crystals, and various other materials.

In addition to these methods, there are several other X-ray techniques, including X-ray fluorescence, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These techniques are employed across various scientific disciplines to analyze the properties of materials and molecules.
