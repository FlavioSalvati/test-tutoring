Wave amplitude refers to the maximum displacement of a wave from its equilibrium position.

In the realm of physics, a wave is defined as a disturbance that propagates through space and time, effectively transferring energy from one location to another. The amplitude of a wave serves as a measure of its strength or intensity. Specifically, it is the maximum displacement from the wave's equilibrium position. In simpler terms, the amplitude is the distance between the crest (the highest point) or trough (the lowest point) of the wave and its rest position.

The amplitude of a wave can be quantified in various units, depending on the type of wave being examined. For instance, the amplitude of a sound wave is measured in decibels ($\text{dB}$), whereas the amplitude of an electromagnetic wave is expressed in volts per meter ($\text{V/m}$). Additionally, the amplitude can be represented as a percentage of its maximum value.

Amplitude is a crucial property that influences a wave's behavior and its interactions with other waves and objects. For example, the amplitude of a sound wave directly affects its loudness; higher amplitudes correspond to louder sounds. Similarly, the amplitude of an electromagnetic wave determines its brightness, with greater amplitudes producing more intense light. Furthermore, amplitude is integral in calculating other wave properties, such as frequency, wavelength, and energy.
