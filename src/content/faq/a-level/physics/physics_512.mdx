Conventional X-rays utilize film to capture images, while digital X-rays employ sensors and computers to generate images.

Conventional X-rays, often referred to as film radiography, rely on photographic film to capture detailed images of the body's internal structures. During the procedure, the X-ray machine emits radiation that penetrates the body. Different tissues absorb this radiation to varying degrees, resulting in an image being formed on the film. This process can take several minutes and necessitates the use of chemicals to develop the film after exposure.

In contrast, digital X-rays utilize advanced sensors and computer technology to create images. The X-ray machine emits radiation that travels through the body and is detected by a sensor. This sensor converts the incoming radiation into an electrical signal, which is subsequently processed by a computer to produce a digital image. This method is significantly faster than conventional X-rays and eliminates the need for chemical development.

Digital X-rays offer several advantages over their conventional counterparts. They generate higher-quality images that can be easily manipulated and enhanced on a computer, facilitating more accurate diagnoses and effective treatment plans. Additionally, digital X-rays require less radiation exposure compared to conventional X-rays, thereby reducing the risk of radiation-related complications for patients.

In summary, while conventional X-rays rely on film to capture images, digital X-rays utilize sensors and computers. The advantages of digital X-rays include superior image quality and reduced radiation exposure for patients, making them a more efficient and safer option in medical imaging.
