To effectively apply Boyle's Law in solving gas-related problems, you can use the formula:

$$
P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2
$$

Boyle's Law states that, at a constant temperature, the pressure and volume of a gas are inversely proportional. This means that as the pressure of a gas increases, its volume decreases, and vice versa. In the formula, $P_1$ and $V_1$ represent the initial pressure and volume, while $P_2$ and $V_2$ denote the final pressure and volume.

When tackling a problem using Boyle's Law, begin by identifying the initial and final conditions of the gas, which should include both the pressure and volume. Next, substitute these values into the equation and solve for the unknown variable. For instance, consider a scenario where the initial pressure and volume of a gas are $2 \, \text{atm}$ and $5 \, \text{L}$, respectively, and the final pressure is $4 \, \text{atm}$. To find the final volume, you can set up the equation:

$$
2 \, \text{atm} \times 5 \, \text{L} = 4 \, \text{atm} \times V_2
$$

Solving for $V_2$ yields:

$$
V_2 = \frac{2 \, \text{atm} \times 5 \, \text{L}}{4 \, \text{atm}} = 2.5 \, \text{L}
$$

It's essential to remember that Boyle's Law applies primarily to ideal gases, which adhere to certain assumptions, such as having negligible intermolecular forces and occupying no volume themselves. Real gases may exhibit deviations from Boyle's Law at elevated pressures or low temperatures. Additionally, since Boyle's Law assumes a constant temperature, if the temperature changes, you will need to utilize another gas law, such as Charles's Law, to analyze the situation accurately.
