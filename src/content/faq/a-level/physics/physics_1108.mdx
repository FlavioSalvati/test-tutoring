The power of a lens is fundamentally defined by its capacity to bend light rays.

The power of a lens quantifies its ability to refract light and is mathematically expressed as the reciprocal of the lens's focal length, which is measured in meters. This power is denoted in diopters (D). A lens with a higher power bends light rays more effectively than a lens with a lower power.

The relationship between the power of a lens and its focal length can be calculated using the formula:

$$ 
P = \frac{1}{f} 
$$

where $ P $ represents the power of the lens in diopters, and $ f $ denotes the focal length in meters. For instance, a lens with a focal length of $0.5$ meters has a power of $2$ diopters, as illustrated by the equation $ P = \frac{1}{0.5} $.

Understanding the power of a lens is crucial for addressing various vision problems. A lens with positive power (a convex lens) is used to correct hyperopia, or farsightedness, by converging light rays onto the retina. Conversely, a lens with negative power (a concave lens) corrects myopia, or nearsightedness, by diverging light rays before they enter the eye.

Beyond correcting vision, lenses with varying powers are essential components in optical instruments such as microscopes and telescopes, where they serve to magnify images. The power of a lens can also be combined with other lenses to form more intricate optical systems, such as camera lenses and telescope eyepieces.
