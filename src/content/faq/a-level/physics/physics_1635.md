To accurately calculate the energy consumption of an electrical appliance, you must know both its power rating and the duration of its usage.

Energy consumption is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). To determine this value, you need the appliance's power rating in watts (W) and the time it is operated in hours (h). You can typically find the power rating on the appliance's label or in the user manual.

The formula to calculate energy consumption is as follows:

$$
\text{Energy consumption} = \frac{\text{Power rating} \times \text{Time used}}{1000}
$$

For instance, if a kettle has a power rating of $1000 \, \text{W}$ and is used for $1 \, \text{h}$, the energy consumption can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Energy consumption} = \frac{1000 \, \text{W} \times 1 \, \text{h}}{1000} = 1 \, \text{kWh}
$$

This formula can also be utilized to estimate the cost of operating the appliance by multiplying the energy consumption by the price per kilowatt-hour from your electricity supplier.

It is important to note that certain appliances may have varying power ratings based on their settings or modes of operation. For example, a laptop may consume less power while in sleep mode compared to its full operational state. Therefore, you should consider these variations when calculating the energy consumption.
