Total internal reflection occurs when light is reflected back into a medium at an interface between two different materials.

When light travels from a denser medium to a less dense medium, it bends away from the normal line at the surface. This bending of light is referred to as refraction. The angle at which light refracts depends on both the angle of incidence and the refractive indices of the two media involved. As the angle of incidence increases, the angle of refraction also increases. At a specific angle of incidence, known as the critical angle, the angle of refraction reaches $90^\circ$. At this point, the refracted ray skims along the boundary of the less dense medium.

If the angle of incidence is increased beyond the critical angle, the refracted ray no longer exists; instead, all of the light is reflected back into the denser medium. This effect is referred to as total internal reflection. The critical angle is determined by the refractive indices of the two media and can be calculated using Snell's law, which is expressed as:

$$ n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2) $$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

Total internal reflection has numerous practical applications. One prominent example is in optical fibers, where light is transmitted through a core with a high refractive index, surrounded by a cladding with a lower refractive index. In this setup, light reflects back and forth within the core, enabling it to travel long distances with minimal energy loss. Additionally, total internal reflection is utilized in devices such as binoculars and periscopes to effectively change the direction of light and enhance image viewing.
