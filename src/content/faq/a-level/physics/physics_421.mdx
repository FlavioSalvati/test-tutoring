Isotopes play a crucial role in radiography, a non-destructive testing technique that produces detailed images of the internal structures of objects.

Radiography employs X-rays or gamma rays to visualize the internal composition of an item without causing any damage. In this process, isotopes serve as sources of gamma rays. Gamma rays are a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation capable of penetrating various materials, enabling the creation of images that reveal the internal features of an object.

Common isotopes used in radiography include cobalt-60 and iridium-192. These isotopes emit gamma rays with energies of approximately $1.17 \, \text{MeV}$ and $1.33 \, \text{MeV}$, respectively. Typically, these isotopes are encapsulated within a small metal container and positioned adjacent to or on the object being examined. As the gamma rays are emitted, they traverse through the object and are detected on the opposite side using either a film or a digital detector.

The transmission of gamma radiation through the object varies depending on the density and thickness of the material. Regions of the object that are denser or thicker will absorb more gamma radiation, resulting in a darker appearance on the radiograph. Conversely, areas that are less dense or thinner will absorb less gamma radiation and will appear lighter on the radiograph.

Radiography is utilized across a wide range of applications, including industrial testing, medical imaging, and security screening. While isotopes provide a safe and effective source of gamma radiation for this technique, it is essential to handle and store them properly to ensure the safety of both workers and the general public.
