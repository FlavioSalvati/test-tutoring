The principle of power transmission in alternating current (AC) circuits relies on the characteristics of alternating current itself.

In AC circuits, power is transmitted by utilizing alternating current, which periodically reverses direction. This periodic change allows for effective energy transfer from the power source to the load. The amount of power transmitted in an AC circuit depends on both the voltage and current present, as well as the phase difference between them.

The power in an AC circuit can be expressed mathematically as:

$$ P = V \cdot I \cdot \text{pf} $$

where $P$ is the power, $V$ is the voltage, $I$ is the current, and $\text{pf}$ is the power factor. The power factor is defined as the cosine of the phase angle between the voltage and current. In a purely resistive circuit, the voltage and current are perfectly in phase, resulting in a power factor of $1$. However, in circuits containing inductors and capacitors, the voltage and current may become out of phase, leading to a power factor that is less than $1$.

To ensure efficient power transmission in AC circuits, it is crucial to minimize losses caused by resistance and reactance. This can be accomplished through the use of transformers, which can either increase or decrease voltage levels, and by incorporating capacitors and inductors to manage reactive power.

In summary, the transmission of power in AC circuits is fundamentally based on the principles of alternating current, which are influenced by voltage, current, and their phase relationship. Achieving efficient power transmission is facilitated by employing transformers and reactive components to mitigate losses.
