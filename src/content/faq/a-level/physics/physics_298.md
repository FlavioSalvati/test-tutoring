Elastic potential energy is conserved in a bouncing ball through the mechanism of elastic deformation.

When a ball is dropped, it gains gravitational potential energy as it descends towards the ground. Upon impact, the ball deforms and compresses, storing a portion of the energy as elastic potential energy. This energy is subsequently released as the ball rebounds, allowing it to return to its original shape. The quantity of elastic potential energy stored in the ball is dependent on both the material properties of the ball and the characteristics of the surface it strikes.

During the bouncing process, some energy is lost due to factors like air resistance and internal friction within the ball. This energy loss results in a reduction in the height of each successive bounce, a phenomenon known as damping. Despite these losses, the total energy in the system remains constant; the energy that is lost is transformed into other forms, such as heat and sound.

In summary, elastic potential energy is conserved in a bouncing ball through elastic deformation and its subsequent release. While some energy is dissipated due to damping, the overall energy in the system remains constant.
