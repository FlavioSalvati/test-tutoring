Particles in the Standard Model are categorized according to their fundamental properties and interactions.

The Standard Model is a theoretical framework that describes the fundamental particles and their interactions via the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces. Within this model, particles are classified based on various characteristics, including mass, spin, and charge, as well as their interactions with other particles.

There are two primary categories of particles in the Standard Model: fermions and bosons. 

- **Fermions** are the building blocks of matter, comprising particles such as electrons, quarks, and neutrinos. They possess half-integer spin and adhere to the Pauli exclusion principle, which dictates that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. 

- **Bosons**, in contrast, are particles responsible for mediating the fundamental forces. Notable examples of bosons include photons, W and Z bosons, and gluons. Bosons have integer spin and do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle.

Fermions are further divided into two subcategories: quarks and leptons. Quarks serve as the fundamental constituents of protons and neutrons, with a total of six distinct types. Leptons include particles such as electrons, muons, and taus, each accompanied by a corresponding neutrino, which is a neutral particle that interacts only weakly with matter.

In summary, the classification of particles in the Standard Model is based on their fundamental properties and interactions. This systematic approach aids physicists in understanding the behavior of these particles and their interactions with one another.
