The principle of marginal rays in optics asserts that the outermost rays of a beam delineate the boundaries of the image formed by an optical system.

When light traverses an optical system, it undergoes refraction as it passes through lenses or reflects off mirrors. The principle of marginal rays is crucial for determining both the size and position of the resulting image. Specifically, the marginal rays are those rays that emerge from the edges of the lens or mirror, effectively defining the limits of the image.

Marginal rays play a vital role in image formation, as they directly influence the image's size. If these rays are not accurately focused, the image may appear blurred or distorted. Consequently, optical systems are meticulously designed to ensure proper focusing of the marginal rays. This is typically achieved by adjusting the shapes and positions of the lenses or mirrors involved.

The principle of marginal rays is integral to a variety of optical systems, including cameras, telescopes, and microscopes. By comprehending this principle, we can enhance the design and construction of optical systems that yield clear and precise images.
