The strength of an electromagnet is influenced by several key factors, primarily the amount of current flowing through its coil.

The relationship between the current and the strength of the electromagnet is direct; specifically, the strength of the magnetic field is directly proportional to the current. This implies that an increase in current will result in a corresponding increase in the strength of the magnetic field generated by the electromagnet. Additionally, the number of turns in the coil plays a significant role. More turns in the coil will yield a stronger magnetic field for the same level of current.

The core material used in the electromagnet also impacts its strength. A soft iron core, for instance, significantly enhances the magnetic field because it can be easily magnetized and demagnetized. Conversely, if the core material is too hard, it may not become magnetized effectively, thereby diminishing the strength of the electromagnet.

Furthermore, the distance between the electromagnet and the object being attracted or repelled is a crucial factor. The strength of the magnetic field diminishes with increasing distance; thus, the closer the object is to the electromagnet, the greater the magnetic force exerted on it.

In summary, the strength of an electromagnet can be adjusted by varying the current flowing through its coil, the number of turns in the coil, the type of core material utilized, and the distance from the electromagnet to the object of interest.
