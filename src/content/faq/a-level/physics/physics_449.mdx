A full-wave rectifier is a circuit that efficiently converts alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC) by utilizing both halves of the input waveform. In contrast to a half-wave rectifier, which only processes one half of the AC cycle, a full-wave rectifier leverages the entire input signal.

The typical configuration of a full-wave rectifier involves four diodes arranged in a bridge formation. The AC voltage is applied across two of the diodes, while the output DC voltage is obtained from the other two diodes. 

During the positive half-cycle of the input waveform, diodes $D_1$ and $D_2$ become forward-biased, allowing current to flow through the load resistor. Meanwhile, diodes $D_3$ and $D_4$ are reverse-biased and prevent current from flowing. In the negative half-cycle, the roles of the diodes reverse: $D_3$ and $D_4$ conduct current while $D_1$ and $D_2$ block it.

As a result of this operation, the output voltage remains positive, with a magnitude that corresponds to the peak value of the input voltage. However, the output voltage is not perfectly smooth; it exhibits some ripple due to the charging and discharging of the output capacitor. This ripple can be minimized by increasing the capacitance of the capacitor or by incorporating a voltage regulator circuit.

In summary, a full-wave rectifier is a more efficient and effective method for converting AC to DC compared to a half-wave rectifier, as it takes advantage of both halves of the input waveform.
