Electric current can pose serious risks to the human body, ranging from mild discomfort to fatal consequences.

When electric current flows through the body, it can lead to tissue damage, burns, and muscle contractions. The extent of the damage is influenced by several factors, including the magnitude of the current, the duration of exposure, and the pathway the current follows through the body.

Low levels of current may induce tingling sensations, while higher levels can result in muscle spasms or even paralysis. If the current traverses the heart, it can lead to cardiac arrest and potentially death.

Moreover, the effects of electric shock may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as muscle pain, headaches, and memory loss can manifest days or even weeks after the initial exposure.

To mitigate these risks, it is essential to observe safety precautions when working with electricity. This includes the use of protective gear and ensuring that electrical circuits are properly grounded. In the event of an electric shock, seeking immediate medical attention is crucial.

In summary, the impact of electric current on the human body can be severe and life-threatening. Understanding these risks and implementing appropriate safety measures is vital for accident prevention.
