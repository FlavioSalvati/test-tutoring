Electrical energy and power in a direct current (DC) circuit can be calculated using the fundamental equations:

$$ P = VI $$

and 

$$ E = Pt $$

where:

- $P$ represents power in watts,
- $V$ denotes voltage in volts,
- $I$ signifies current in amperes,
- $E$ indicates energy in joules, and
- $t$ stands for time in seconds.

In a DC circuit, the electrical power is determined by the equation $P = VI$. This relationship illustrates that power is directly proportional to both voltage and current. Consequently, an increase in either voltage or current will result in a corresponding increase in the power within the circuit.

Similarly, electrical energy is computed using the equation $E = Pt$. This equation shows that energy is directly proportional to both power and time. Therefore, an increase in either power or time will lead to an increase in the total energy consumed by the circuit.

It is essential to remember that both electrical power and energy are scalar quantities, which means they possess magnitude but no direction. Both quantities are measured in International System (SI) units, with power expressed in watts and energy in joules.

In summary, a clear understanding of how to calculate electrical power and energy in a DC circuit is vital for analyzing and designing electrical systems. This knowledge is also crucial for comprehending the behavior of various electrical components, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
