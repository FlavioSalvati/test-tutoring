An LC circuit operates on the principle of energy oscillation between an inductor and a capacitor.

An LC circuit, commonly referred to as a resonant circuit, consists of an inductor ($L$) and a capacitor ($C$) connected in such a way that they can exchange energy. The fundamental concept of an LC circuit is that energy oscillates back and forth between the inductor and the capacitor at a specific frequency, known as the resonant frequency. This oscillation produces a sinusoidal waveform, which is utilized in various applications, including radio tuning circuits and electronic filters.

The resonant frequency of an LC circuit is determined by the values of the inductor and capacitor, as well as the physical characteristics of the circuit. When the circuit is initially energized, the capacitor begins to charge, storing energy. As the capacitor accumulates charge, the current flowing through the inductor increases, creating a magnetic field around it. This magnetic field stores energy, which is then released back into the circuit as the capacitor discharges.

The oscillation between the inductor and capacitor continues until the energy dissipates due to resistance or other losses in the circuit. The frequency of oscillation can be modified by adjusting the values of the inductor and capacitor, allowing the circuit to be tuned to a specific frequency. This tunability makes LC circuits particularly advantageous for applications such as radio communication and electronic filters, where precise frequency control is essential.
