Radiopharmaceuticals function by emitting radiation that can be detected by imaging equipment utilized in nuclear medicine.

These specialized drugs contain a radioactive substance known as a radionuclide. When administered to patients—either orally or intravenously—the radionuclide travels to the intended organ or tissue. Upon reaching its target, the radionuclide emits radiation that can be detected by imaging technologies, such as gamma cameras or positron emission tomography (PET) scanners.

The type of radiation emitted by a radionuclide is determined by its intrinsic properties, including its half-life and energy level. For instance, gamma radiation is typically emitted by radionuclides with longer half-lives, whereas positron emission occurs with radionuclides that have shorter half-lives. The imaging equipment captures this emitted radiation and generates images of the targeted organ or tissue, enabling healthcare professionals to diagnose and monitor various diseases effectively.

Radiopharmaceuticals are employed in numerous medical procedures, including bone scans, cardiac stress tests, and cancer imaging. Additionally, they play a significant role in targeted therapy, where the emitted radiation is used to selectively destroy cancer cells.

In summary, radiopharmaceuticals are essential in nuclear medicine, providing doctors with the ability to visualize and treat diseases through the use of radiation.
