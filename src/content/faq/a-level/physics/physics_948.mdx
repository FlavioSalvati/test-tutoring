A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that permits current to flow in only one direction, whereas a transistor is a three-terminal electronic component capable of amplifying or switching electronic signals.

Diodes consist of a p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor, which are joined to create a p-n junction. When a voltage is applied across the diode in the forward direction, the p-n junction allows current to flow. Conversely, when the voltage is applied in the reverse direction, the diode behaves like an insulator and prevents current from flowing.

Transistors, in contrast, are constructed from three layers of semiconductor material: an emitter, a base, and a collector. By applying a small current to the base, it is possible to control a larger current flowing between the emitter and the collector. This characteristic makes transistors particularly useful for amplifying and switching electronic signals.

While diodes are primarily employed for rectification and voltage regulation, transistors find applications in a diverse array of electronic devices, including amplifiers, oscillators, and digital circuits. Together, diodes and transistors are fundamental components in modern electronics, serving a wide range of applications.
