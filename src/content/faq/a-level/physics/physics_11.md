The concept of ductility refers to a material's capacity to be stretched or deformed without fracturing.

Ductility is characterized by a material's ability to undergo plastic deformation without breaking. When a force is applied to a ductile material, it can deform and elongate without developing cracks or fractures. This behavior arises from the material's ability to rearrange its atomic and molecular structure in response to the applied stress. Ductility is a crucial property in various engineering applications because it enables materials to be shaped into a wide range of forms and sizes.

The ductility of a material can be quantitatively assessed through two primary measures: elongation and reduction in area. Elongation is defined as the percentage increase in the length of a material when subjected to tensile stress, whereas reduction in area refers to the percentage decrease in the cross-sectional area of the material under the same conditions. Generally, the greater the elongation and reduction in area, the more ductile the material is considered to be.

Common examples of ductile materials include copper, gold, aluminum, and steel. These materials find extensive applications in construction, manufacturing, and electrical sectors due to their ductile nature. However, it is important to recognize that ductility may not be advantageous in all scenarios. For instance, brittle materials such as glass and ceramics lack ductility but are valuable in specific applications where their hardness and rigidity are prioritized over their ability to deform.
