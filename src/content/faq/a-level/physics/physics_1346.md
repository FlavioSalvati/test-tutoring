Young's modulus is a fundamental parameter that quantifies a material's resistance to deformation when subjected to stress, thereby indicating its rigidity.

Also referred to as the modulus of elasticity, Young's modulus is defined as the ratio of stress to strain in a material when it is either stretched (tension) or compressed. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}
$$

where $E$ represents Young's modulus, $\sigma$ is the stress applied to the material, and $\epsilon$ is the strain experienced by the material. A higher value of Young's modulus signifies a stiffer material that is more resistant to deformation under applied stress.

For instance, steel exhibits a high Young's modulus, which contributes to its rigidity. This characteristic makes steel a preferred choice in construction and engineering applications where strength and durability are crucial. In contrast, rubber has a low Young's modulus, making it a more flexible material. This property is why rubber is commonly used in products such as tires and shock absorbers, where flexibility is essential for absorbing impacts and preventing damage.

When selecting materials for specific applications, Young's modulus is a critical property to consider. It helps predict how a material will respond under stress and assists engineers in designing structures and products that are robust, durable, and safe.

In summary, Young's modulus plays a vital role in assessing the rigidity of materials. It serves as a measure of a material's capacity to resist deformation under stress and is an essential consideration in various engineering and construction contexts.
