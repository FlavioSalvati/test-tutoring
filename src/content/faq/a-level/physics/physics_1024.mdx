The energy stored in a compressed spring is known as elastic potential energy. 

When a spring is compressed, work is performed on it, leading to its deformation. This deformation allows the spring to store potential energy, specifically elastic potential energy. The amount of potential energy stored in a spring is directly proportional to the degree of deformation it experiences. This relationship is succinctly described by Hooke's Law, which asserts that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to its deformation.

The formula for calculating the elastic potential energy stored in a compressed spring is:

$$
PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

In this equation, $PE$ represents the potential energy stored in the spring, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position.

The elastic potential energy stored in a compressed spring can be harnessed to perform work. For instance, a compressed spring can power mechanical devices such as clocks or toys. When the spring is released, the stored potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy, enabling it to perform work.

In summary, the elastic potential energy stored in a compressed spring is a crucial concept in physics. It represents a form of stored energy that can be utilized to do work and is directly proportional to the extent of the spring's deformation.
