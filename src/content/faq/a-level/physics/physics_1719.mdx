The power factor is defined as the ratio of real power to apparent power within an electrical circuit.

In alternating current (AC) circuits, the power factor serves as a key indicator of how effectively the circuit utilizes the supplied power. It is mathematically expressed as the ratio of real power (measured in watts, $W$) to apparent power (measured in volt-amperes, $VA$). Real power represents the actual energy consumed by the circuit to perform useful tasks, such as operating a motor or illuminating a light bulb. In contrast, apparent power is calculated as the product of voltage and current in the circuit, reflecting the total power delivered to the circuit.

A power factor of $1$ signifies that the circuit is utilizing all the supplied power for productive work. Conversely, a power factor of less than $1$ indicates that a portion of the supplied power is being wasted. This inefficiency often arises in circuits with reactive components, such as capacitors or inductors, which store and subsequently release energy back into the circuit. The presence of reactive power does not contribute to useful work and can lead to a phase difference between voltage and current, thereby diminishing the overall power factor.

Enhancing the power factor can lead to reduced energy consumption and improved circuit efficiency. This enhancement can be accomplished by incorporating power factor correction devices, such as capacitors or inductors, into the circuit. These devices help to counterbalance the reactive power, ultimately improving the power factor and facilitating a more efficient use of the supplied power.
