The SI unit of force is the Newton, denoted as $N$.

A Newton is defined as the force necessary to produce an acceleration of $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$ on a mass of $1 \, \text{kg}$. In simpler terms, when a force of $1 \, N$ is exerted on an object weighing $1 \, kg$, that object will accelerate at a rate of $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$.

The unit is named in honor of Sir Isaac Newton, renowned for his foundational contributions to physics, particularly his laws of motion. These laws provide a framework for understanding how objects move and interact when forces are applied.

In addition to the Newton, various other units of force are utilized in specific contexts. For instance, the pound-force (lbf) is prevalent in the United States, while the poundal (pdl) is sometimes employed in scientific contexts. Nevertheless, the Newton remains the standard unit of force within the International System of Units (SI).

Grasping the concept of force as a unit is crucial across numerous fields of physics, including mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. It enables us to quantify the influence of forces on objects and to predict their behavior under varying conditions.
