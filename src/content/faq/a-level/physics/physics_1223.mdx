Momentum is conserved during particle interactions, which is a fundamental consequence of the principle of conservation of momentum.

When two particles interact, they exchange momentum. However, the total momentum of the system before the interaction is equal to the total momentum after the interaction. This is formally known as the principle of conservation of momentum.

Mathematically, the conservation of momentum can be expressed as follows: the sum of the momenta of the particles before the interaction equals the sum of the momenta of the particles after the interaction. In concise terms, the total momentum of the system remains constant throughout the interaction.

This principle is particularly important in the field of particle physics, where particles frequently interact at high velocities. For instance, during a collision between two particles, momentum is transferred from one particle to the other, resulting in changes to their velocities. Despite these individual changes, the overall momentum of the system remains unchanged.

Moreover, the conservation of momentum is crucial in the operation of particle accelerators, where particles are propelled to high speeds and collide with one another. By applying the principle of momentum conservation, physicists can analyze and deduce the properties of the particles involved in these high-energy collisions.

In summary, momentum is conserved in particle interactions due to the principle of conservation of momentum. This principle is vital for understanding the dynamics of particles during collisions and in particle accelerators.
