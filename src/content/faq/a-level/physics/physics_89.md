Electromagnetic shielding is the technique employed to reduce the electromagnetic field in a given area.

This process involves utilizing conductive or magnetic materials to obstruct electromagnetic fields, thereby safeguarding sensitive electronic equipment from electromagnetic interference (EMI) and preventing unwanted electromagnetic radiation from escaping devices. The fundamental principle behind electromagnetic shielding lies in the ability of conductive materials—such as copper, aluminum, or steel—to block electromagnetic waves. These materials serve as barriers that either reflect or absorb the waves, effectively preventing their transmission through the shielding medium.

There are two primary types of electromagnetic shielding: magnetic shielding and electric shielding. Magnetic shielding utilizes specific materials to generate a magnetic field that counteracts the original field, whereas electric shielding employs conductive materials to create barriers that reflect or absorb electromagnetic waves. The choice between these two types of shielding depends on the nature of the electromagnetic interference that needs to be mitigated.

In summary, electromagnetic shielding is a crucial practice in electronics, aimed at preventing electromagnetic interference and protecting sensitive equipment. The effectiveness of electromagnetic shielding is fundamentally rooted in the use of conductive or magnetic materials to obstruct the passage of electromagnetic waves through a designated space.
