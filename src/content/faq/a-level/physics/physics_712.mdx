Young's modulus is determined experimentally by measuring the stress and strain of a material.

To ascertain Young's modulus, a sample of the material is subjected to tensile stress, which induces stretching. The extent of the stretch is measured and recorded, along with the force applied to the sample. These measurements are critical for calculating strain, defined as the amount of deformation per unit length.

Subsequently, stress is calculated by dividing the applied force by the cross-sectional area of the sample. The stress and strain values are then plotted on a graph, with stress represented on the y-axis and strain on the x-axis. The slope of the resulting straight line corresponds to Young's modulus.

It is essential to conduct the test within the material's elastic limit. The elastic limit is the maximum stress that can be applied without causing permanent deformation; beyond this point, the material will not return to its original shape after the stress is removed. If the material is tested beyond its elastic limit, it will experience plastic deformation, leading to a non-linear stress-strain curve.

In summary, determining Young's modulus experimentally involves measuring the stress and strain of a material, plotting the resulting data on a graph, and calculating the slope of the line, which represents the modulus of elasticity.
