The focal length of a mirror is defined as the distance between the mirror and its focal point.

To determine the focal length of a mirror, one can apply the mirror formula, which establishes a relationship among the distance of the object from the mirror ($u$), the distance of the image from the mirror ($v$), and the focal length of the mirror ($f$). The mirror formula is given by:

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}.
$$

To utilize this formula, place an object at a known distance from the mirror and measure the distance of the image formed by the mirror. By substituting these measured values into the mirror formula, the focal length of the mirror can be calculated.

Another effective method for measuring the focal length of a mirror involves using a collimated beam of light. A collimated beam is one that is parallel to the axis of the mirror. By measuring the distance from the mirror to the point where this beam converges, one can ascertain the focal length of the mirror.

Additionally, a concave mirror can be employed to create a real image of a distant object. By measuring the distance between the mirror and this real image, the focal length can again be determined using the mirror formula.

In summary, there are various methods to accurately measure the focal length of a mirror, including using the mirror formula, employing a collimated beam of light, and forming a real image of a distant object.
