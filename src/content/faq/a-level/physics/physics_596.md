The stress in a pressurized cylinder is calculated using the formula:

$$ \text{Stress} = \frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Area}} $$

When gas is stored in a pressurized cylinder, the pressure within the cylinder increases. This pressure exerts a force on the walls of the cylinder, leading to stress. Stress is defined as the force applied per unit area and is measured in pascals (Pa).

To determine the stress in a pressurized cylinder, we first need to calculate the force exerted by the gas on the cylinder's walls. This force is given by the product of the gas pressure and the surface area of the cylinder:

$$ \text{Force} = \text{Pressure} \times \text{Area} $$

The area of the cylinder's cross-section can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle, which is derived from the cylinder's diameter. Specifically, if $d$ is the diameter, the area $A$ can be expressed as:

$$ A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} $$

Once we have determined the force, we can calculate the stress by dividing the force by the area:

$$ \text{Stress} = \frac{\text{Force}}{A} $$

This calculated stress value is crucial for assessing the strength of the cylinder and determining whether it can safely withstand the internal gas pressure.

It is essential to recognize that the stress experienced by a pressurized cylinder can vary based on the material from which it is made and its thickness. Different materials possess unique strength characteristics and can tolerate different stress levels. Therefore, selecting the appropriate material and wall thickness for a pressurized cylinder is vital, particularly in relation to the gas pressure it will contain.
