Lenz's law states that the direction of an induced current in a circuit opposes the change that caused it.

When a magnetic field changes in proximity to a conductor, it induces an electromotive force (EMF) that generates a current within the conductor. Lenz's law helps us determine the direction of this induced current. Specifically, it asserts that the induced current flows in such a way that it opposes the change in the magnetic field. For instance, if the magnetic field is increasing, the induced current will flow in a direction that generates a magnetic field opposing this increase. Conversely, if the magnetic field is decreasing, the induced current will flow in a direction that produces a magnetic field which counters the decrease.

Lenz's law is fundamentally linked to the principle of conservation of energy. The induced current produces a magnetic field that opposes the alteration in the original magnetic field. Consequently, energy is required to sustain the original magnetic field, and this energy is provided by the work performed on the conductor by the changing magnetic field.

Lenz's law has numerous practical applications, particularly in electric generators and motors. In a generator, the movement of a conductor through a magnetic field induces a current that can be harnessed to generate electricity. In contrast, in a motor, a current flowing through a conductor within a magnetic field generates a force that causes the conductor to move. By comprehending Lenz's law, we can design more efficient and effective electromagnetic devices.
