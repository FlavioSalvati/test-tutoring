The principle of axial rays in optics asserts that rays of light that pass through the center of a lens remain undeviated.

When light encounters a lens, it undergoes refraction, which causes a change in its direction. The extent of this refraction is influenced by both the angle of incidence and the refractive index of the lens material. However, when a ray of light passes through the center of a lens, it does so perpendicularly to the surface, resulting in no change in direction. This occurs because the angle of incidence is zero, leading to an absence of refraction.

Axial rays play a crucial role in the design of optical systems, as they facilitate the formation of clear images. When an object is positioned in front of a lens, the axial rays that pass through the center converge at a specific point located behind the lens. This point is referred to as the focal point, and the distance from the lens to the focal point is known as the focal length.

By manipulating the placement and curvature of lenses, optical systems can be engineered to generate clear and magnified images. The principle of axial rays is fundamental to this process, as it guarantees that the image remains undistorted and sharp, free from blurriness caused by the refraction of light passing through the lens.
