Radiopharmaceuticals are specialized drugs that incorporate radioactive isotopes and are utilized in cancer therapy to deliver targeted radiation directly to cancer cells.

These drugs work by injecting the radiopharmaceutical into the patient's bloodstream. Once administered, the radiopharmaceutical circulates through the body and selectively accumulates in cancerous tissues. The radiation emitted by the radioactive isotopes damages the DNA of the cancer cells, ultimately leading to their destruction.

One prominent category of radiopharmaceuticals employed in cancer treatment is known as radioligands. Radioligands are specific molecules that bind to receptors located on the surface of cancer cells. Upon binding, the radioactive isotope within the radioligand emits radiation, inflicting damage to the cancer cell.

Another important type of radiopharmaceutical is referred to as a radiopharmaceutical conjugate. These conjugates are engineered to selectively target cancer cells and consist of both a radioactive isotope and a binding molecule that attaches to a specific receptor on the cancer cell. Similar to radioligands, once the radiopharmaceutical conjugate binds to the cancer cell, the radioactive isotope releases radiation that harms the cancerous tissue.

Radiopharmaceuticals are frequently used in conjunction with other cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, they are effective in treating metastatic cancer, as the radiopharmaceuticals can navigate through the bloodstream to reach cancer cells that have spread to various parts of the body.
