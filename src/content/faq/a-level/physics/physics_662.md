The distribution of galaxies offers compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter, particularly through phenomena such as gravitational lensing and galaxy rotation curves.

Galaxies are not randomly scattered throughout the universe; instead, they organize into large-scale structures, including clusters and filaments. However, the gravitational attraction among galaxies within these structures is insufficient to keep them bound together. This observation leads scientists to conclude that there must be additional, unseen matter presentâ€”commonly referred to as dark matter.

One significant way in which the distribution of galaxies indicates the presence of dark matter is through gravitational lensing. When light from a distant galaxy passes near the gravitational field of a closer galaxy, the light is bent and distorted. By analyzing these distortions, researchers can map the distribution of dark matter throughout the universe.

Another method by which galaxy distribution supports the existence of dark matter is through the analysis of galaxy rotation curves. According to Newton's laws of gravity, we would expect the outer regions of a galaxy to rotate more slowly than the inner regions. Contrary to this expectation, observations reveal that galaxies tend to rotate at a nearly constant speed, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass. This unseen mass is hypothesized to be dark matter.

In summary, the distribution of galaxies provides robust evidence for dark matter's existence. Through the mechanisms of gravitational lensing and the study of galaxy rotation curves, scientists have been able to map dark matter's distribution in the universe and infer its properties. While the exact nature of dark matter remains elusive, its influence on galaxy distribution offers strong support for its existence.
