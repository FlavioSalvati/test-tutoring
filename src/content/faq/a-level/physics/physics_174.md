The stress experienced by a beam can be determined by dividing the applied force by the beam's cross-sectional area.

When an external force acts on a beam, it induces stress, which is the internal resistance the beam offers against that force. The relationship between stress, applied force, and cross-sectional area is straightforward: stress is directly proportional to the applied force and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Thus, the formula for calculating stress can be expressed as:

$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
$$

where $\sigma$ is the stress, $F$ is the applied force, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area.

The nature of the stress in a beam can be classified as either tensile or compressive, depending on the direction of the applied force. Tensile stress arises when the force tends to pull the beam apart, while compressive stress occurs when the force pushes the beam together. The maximum stress that a beam can endure before failure is referred to as the yield stress.

It is crucial to understand that stress is not uniformly distributed throughout the beam. The highest stress typically occurs at the location where the force is applied, gradually decreasing towards the ends of the beam. This variation is a result of the bending action, which causes the upper section of the beam to experience tensile stress and the lower section to undergo compressive stress.

In summary, the stress in a beam is calculated by the formula:

$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
$$

Comprehending the stress distribution within a beam is essential for the effective design of structures that must endure external forces without succumbing to failure.
