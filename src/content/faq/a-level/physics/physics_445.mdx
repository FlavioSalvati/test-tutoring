During alpha decay, a nucleus releases an alpha particle, which is composed of two protons and two neutrons.

Alpha decay is a specific type of radioactive decay characterized by the emission of an alpha particle, essentially a helium nucleus comprising two protons and two neutrons. This process results in a decrease of the atomic number by $2$ and a reduction of the mass number by $4$.

The emitted alpha particle possesses a certain amount of energy, which is determined by the mass difference between the parent nucleus and the resulting daughter nucleus. This energy is distributed between the alpha particle and the recoiling daughter nucleus, which moves in the opposite direction of the emitted alpha particle.

Alpha decay is particularly prevalent in heavy nuclei, such as those of uranium and thorium, which contain an excess of protons and neutrons, making them unstable. By emitting alpha particles, these nuclei can transition toward a more stable configuration, moving closer to the stable region in the nuclear chart.

Furthermore, alpha decay has various practical applications. For instance, in smoke detectors, alpha particles ionize air molecules, creating a detectable current. Additionally, in nuclear power plants, the heat generated from alpha decay is harnessed to produce steam, which then drives turbines to generate electricity.
