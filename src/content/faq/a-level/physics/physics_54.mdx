The shear modulus, also referred to as the modulus of rigidity, quantifies a material's resistance to deformation when subjected to shear stress. It is mathematically defined as the ratio of shear stress to shear strain within the material's elastic limit. In simpler terms, the shear modulus indicates how effectively a material resists twisting or shearing forces.

A material with a higher shear modulus exhibits greater rigidity, meaning it is more resistant to deformation under shear stress. For instance, steel possesses a higher shear modulus compared to rubber, making it more rigid and less likely to deform when exposed to shear forces.

The shear modulus is a critical property to consider in the design of structures that will experience shear stress, such as bridges and aircraft wings. In these applications, materials with a high shear modulus are preferred because they are less prone to deformation or failure under stress.

In summary, the shear modulus is directly proportional to a material's rigidity. A higher shear modulus corresponds to a more rigid material, which is essential for applications where resistance to shear stress is paramount.
