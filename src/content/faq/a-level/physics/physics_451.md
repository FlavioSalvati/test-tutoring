A Geiger counter is an instrument designed to detect and measure ionizing radiation by assessing the ionizing effects of radiation on a gas-filled tube.

This device consists of a metal gas-filled tube with a thin wire running through its center. When ionizing radiation penetrates the tube, it ionizes the gas molecules, resulting in a flow of charged particles that move toward the wire. The Geiger counter amplifies this current and counts the resulting pulses.

Typically, the gas-filled tube in a Geiger counter is filled with a low-pressure inert gas, such as helium or neon, along with a small quantity of halogen gas, like iodine or bromine. The presence of the halogen gas enhances the tube's sensitivity to ionizing radiation.

As ionizing radiation enters the tube, it triggers a cascade of ionization events, generating a significant number of charged particles. These particles produce an electrical pulse that the Geiger counter detects. The magnitude of the pulse correlates with the energy of the ionizing radiation that has entered the tube.

Geiger counters find widespread use in various fields, including radiation protection, nuclear medicine, and environmental monitoring. They are user-friendly and offer a quick and effective means of detecting ionizing radiation. However, it is important to note that Geiger counters are not designed to measure the energy or direction of radiation. Therefore, they are often used in combination with other instruments for more comprehensive measurements.
