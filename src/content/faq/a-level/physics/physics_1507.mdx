An electric generator is a device that transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy.

Electric generators operate based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, a phenomenon discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831. The fundamental components of an electric generator include a rotor, a stator, and a source of mechanical energy. The rotor is the rotating part that generates a magnetic field, while the stator is the stationary part that houses a series of conductive coils. The source of mechanical energy can vary widely, ranging from steam turbines to wind turbines.

As the rotor spins, it creates a changing magnetic field, which induces an electrical current in the conductive coils of the stator. This electrical current is then transmitted to an external circuit, where it can be utilized to power various electrical devices. The amount of electrical energy generated by an electric generator is influenced by several factors, such as the size and rotational speed of the rotor, the strength of the magnetic field, and the number of conductive coils present in the stator.

Electric generators play a vital role in numerous applications, from large power plants to portable generators. They are essential for supplying electricity to homes, businesses, and industries worldwide. A solid understanding of how electric generators function is important for anyone pursuing a career in electrical engineering or renewable energy.
