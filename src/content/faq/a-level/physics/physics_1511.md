The rate of heat transfer increases with a larger temperature gradient.

When there exists a temperature difference between two objects, heat naturally flows from the hotter object to the cooler one. The rate of heat transfer, defined as the amount of heat transferred per unit time, is directly proportional to the temperature gradient, which is the difference in temperature between the two objects.

This phenomenon can be explained by the second law of thermodynamics, which asserts that heat will always flow from a hotter object to a cooler one until both reach thermal equilibrium. The larger the temperature difference, the greater the driving force for heat transfer, leading to a higher rate of heat transfer.

For instance, consider a hot cup of coffee left in a cool room. The significant temperature gradient between the coffee and the surrounding air results in a rapid cooling of the coffee as heat is transferred to the air. Conversely, if the same cup of coffee is placed in a warmer room, the temperature gradient diminishes, leading to a slower rate of heat transfer and, consequently, a more gradual cooling of the coffee.
