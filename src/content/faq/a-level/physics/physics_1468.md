To determine the percentage uncertainty of a measurement, you divide the uncertainty by the measured value and then multiply the result by $100$.

In any measurement, there is an inherent degree of uncertainty due to limitations in the measuring instrument and the skill of the operator. To quantify this uncertainty, we can calculate the percentage uncertainty, which expresses the uncertainty as a percentage of the measured value. This metric indicates how much the measurement could deviate from the true value.

To calculate the percentage uncertainty, the first step is to ascertain the uncertainty associated with the measurement. This uncertainty is usually provided by the manufacturer of the measuring device or can be estimated based on the precision of the instrument and the operator's skill. Once you have the uncertainty, you calculate the percentage uncertainty by dividing the uncertainty by the measured value and multiplying by $100$.

For instance, if we measure a length of $10 \, \text{cm}$ with an uncertainty of $0.1 \, \text{cm}$, the percentage uncertainty can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{Percentage Uncertainty} = \left( \frac{0.1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 1\%
$$

This result indicates that the true value of the length could range from $9.9 \, \text{cm}$ to $10.1 \, \text{cm}$, assuming a $68\%$ confidence interval.

It is important to recognize that the percentage uncertainty is merely an estimate of the true uncertainty. It does not account for systematic errors or other potential sources of uncertainty. Nevertheless, it serves as a valuable tool for comparing the relative uncertainties of different measurements and for assessing the significance of any observed differences between them.
