To calculate the work done by a torque, you need to multiply the torque by the angle through which it acts.

When a force is applied to an object, causing it to rotate around an axis, the torque is defined as the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force. The unit of torque is the Newton-meter (Nm).

The work done by a torque takes into account the angle through which it acts. Work is generally defined as the product of the force and the displacement in the direction of that force. In this context, the force corresponds to the torque, and the displacement is represented by the angle of rotation. The unit of work is the Joule (J).

Hence, the work done by a torque can be expressed using the formula:

$$
\text{Work} = \text{Torque} \times \text{Angle}
$$

This formula is applicable in various scenarios, such as when using a wrench to tighten a bolt or when a motor rotates a shaft.

It is crucial to note that the angle must be measured in radians for this formula to be valid. If the angle is provided in degrees, it should be converted to radians by multiplying by $\frac{\pi}{180}$.
