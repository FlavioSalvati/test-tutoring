Radiation plays a crucial role in sterilization processes by effectively eliminating microorganisms and inhibiting their growth.

This method can be employed to sterilize various items, including medical equipment, food, and other items that require a microbial-free environment. There are two primary categories of radiation used for sterilization: ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation.

**Ionizing Radiation**  
Ionizing radiation, which includes gamma rays and X-rays, possesses the ability to penetrate deeply into materials. This type of radiation disrupts the DNA of microorganisms, effectively killing them and preventing their replication. It is commonly utilized in the sterilization of medical instruments, such as surgical tools, as well as pharmaceutical products.

**Non-Ionizing Radiation**  
Non-ionizing radiation, exemplified by ultraviolet (UV) light, is less energetic than ionizing radiation but can still be effective for sterilization purposes. UV light is capable of destroying bacteria and viruses on exposed surfaces; however, it does not penetrate materials, making it primarily suitable for sterilizing air and water.

While radiation sterilization is an exceptionally effective method for ensuring items are free from harmful microorganisms, it comes with certain limitations. For instance, it may damage specific materials, such as certain plastics, and the initial setup and ongoing maintenance of the necessary equipment can be costly. Nonetheless, for numerous applications, radiation sterilization remains the most reliable option for achieving a sterile environment.
