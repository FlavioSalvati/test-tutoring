The power factor in an alternating current (AC) circuit is defined as the ratio of real power to apparent power.

In an AC circuit, the power factor serves as a measure of the circuit's efficiency in utilizing the power supplied to it. Specifically, it is given by the ratio of real power (measured in watts, $W$) to apparent power (measured in volt-amperes, $VA$). Real power represents the energy actually used to perform work—such as illuminating a bulb or powering a motor—whereas apparent power encompasses the total power delivered to the circuit, including any losses incurred due to resistance in wires or other circuit components.

When the power factor is equal to $1.0$, it indicates that all of the power supplied to the circuit is effectively being used for work. Conversely, a power factor lower than $1.0$ signifies that a portion of the power is lost due to inefficiencies within the circuit. These inefficiencies can arise from various factors, including inductive loads (like motors or transformers) and capacitive loads (such as fluorescent lights).

To enhance the power factor of a circuit, it is often necessary to implement power factor correction methods, which may involve the addition of capacitors or other devices. These components help to mitigate the amount of reactive power present in the circuit, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the system. A solid understanding of the power factor is crucial for effective AC circuit analysis and design.
