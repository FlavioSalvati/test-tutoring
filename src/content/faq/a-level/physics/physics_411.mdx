Population I, II, and III stars exhibit distinct differences in terms of their age, metallicity, and spatial distribution within galaxies.

**Population I Stars**  
Population I stars are relatively young and metal-rich, typically found in the disk of the Milky Way. These stars are generally less than $10$ billion years old and possess a high abundance of heavy elements, including carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Their formation occurs from gas and dust clouds that have been enriched by the stellar processes of previous generations.

**Population II Stars**  
In contrast, Population II stars are older and metal-poor, located primarily in the halo and bulge of the Milky Way. These stars are usually over $10$ billion years old and contain a low abundance of heavy elements. They are believed to have formed from primordial gas that existed in the universe before the emergence of the first generation of stars.

**Population III Stars**  
Population III stars are theoretical constructs representing extremely metal-poor stars thought to have formed in the early universe. It is believed that they originated from the initial clouds of hydrogen and helium that collapsed under their own gravity. These stars would have been massive and short-lived, with their remnants potentially detectable today as either black holes or neutron stars.

The study of Population I, II, and III stars offers valuable insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies, as well as the characteristics of the early universe.
