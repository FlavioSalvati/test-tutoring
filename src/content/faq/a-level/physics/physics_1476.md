A telescope operates by collecting and focusing light from distant celestial objects to create a clear image.

A typical telescope comprises two primary components: the objective lens (or mirror) and the eyepiece. The objective lens or mirror is tasked with capturing light from distant sources and concentrating it to form an image. The eyepiece then magnifies this image, allowing the observer to see it in greater detail.

The objective lens or mirror is typically the largest part of the telescope and is positioned at the front of the instrument. Its design aims to maximize light collection from distant objects, which it then focuses to produce a clear image. The specific shape of the objective lens or mirror dictates the type of telescope. Refracting telescopes utilize a convex lens to bend and focus light, whereas reflecting telescopes employ a concave mirror to reflect and concentrate light.

The eyepiece is situated at the rear of the telescope and is responsible for magnifying the image created by the objective lens or mirror. The degree of magnification is determined by the focal length of the eyepiece; a longer focal length results in greater magnification.

Telescopes are invaluable tools for observing a vast array of objects in the night sky, including planets, stars, galaxies, and nebulae. They are also used in scientific research to investigate the properties of these objects and to facilitate new discoveries about the universe.
