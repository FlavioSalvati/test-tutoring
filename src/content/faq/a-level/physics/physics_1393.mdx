The peak value in an alternating current (AC) circuit refers to the maximum voltage or current level, while the root mean square (RMS) value represents the equivalent direct current (DC) value that would produce the same heating effect in a resistor.

In an AC circuit, both voltage and current fluctuate sinusoidally over time. The peak value is the highest point reached by the voltage or current. In contrast, the RMS value is derived from the square root of the average of the squares of the voltage or current over one complete cycle.

For instance, if the peak voltage is $10 \, V$, the corresponding RMS value is approximately $7.07 \, V$. This indicates that a DC voltage of $7.07 \, V$ would generate the same heating effect in a resistor as an AC voltage of $10 \, V$. Grasping these values is essential for understanding the characteristics of alternating currents, including waveform parameters, which can be explored further through various educational resources.

The peak value is crucial for determining the maximum voltage or current that a circuit can withstand without incurring damage. On the other hand, the RMS value plays a vital role in calculating power in AC circuits, as power is proportional to the square of the RMS value. To fully appreciate how these measurements fit into the broader context of physics, a foundational understanding of electrical principles is beneficial.

### Summary for A-Level Physics:
In AC circuits, the peak value represents the highest voltage or current, which is critical for ensuring circuit safety. The RMS value, which corresponds to a constant DC value, is essential for calculating the power consumed. Understanding these concepts aids in managing circuit voltage limits and power consumption, both of which are significant for practical applications in physics.
