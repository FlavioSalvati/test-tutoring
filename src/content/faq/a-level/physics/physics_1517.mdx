To calculate the energy released in a nuclear reaction, we utilize Einstein's renowned equation:

$$ E = mc^2 $$

In any nuclear reaction, the total mass of the reactants does not equal the total mass of the products. This discrepancy in mass is referred to as the mass defect. The mass defect is converted into energy as per Einstein's equation, where $E$ signifies the energy released, $m$ represents the mass defect, and $c$ denotes the speed of light.

To determine the mass defect, we subtract the total mass of the products from the total mass of the reactants. This resulting mass defect is then multiplied by $c^2$ to yield the energy released in the reaction.

For instance, consider the fusion reaction between two hydrogen atoms that results in the formation of a helium atom. The mass of the helium atom is less than the combined mass of the two hydrogen atoms. The difference in mass, or mass defect, is transformed into energy, which is emitted in the form of light and heat.

Additionally, the energy released in a nuclear reaction can be calculated using the concept of binding energy per nucleon. Binding energy is defined as the energy required to separate a nucleus into its individual nucleons. The binding energy per nucleon is calculated by dividing the total binding energy by the number of nucleons within the nucleus. The difference in binding energy per nucleon between the reactants and the products indicates the energy released during the reaction.

In conclusion, the energy released in a nuclear reaction can be computed either using Einstein's equation or by examining the difference in binding energy per nucleon between the reactants and products.
