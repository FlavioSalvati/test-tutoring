The distance to Cepheid variable stars is determined through their period-luminosity relationship.

Cepheid variable stars are a type of pulsating star that exhibit changes in brightness over a consistent period. The duration of their brightness fluctuations is directly correlated with their luminosity, or intrinsic brightness. This significant relationship was first identified by Henrietta Leavitt in 1912, who observed that brighter Cepheids have longer pulsation periods.

By measuring the period of a Cepheid variable star, astronomers can ascertain its intrinsic brightness. They then compare this intrinsic brightness to the star's apparent brightness as observed from Earth, allowing them to calculate the distance to the star using the inverse square law of light. This law states that the apparent brightness of an object decreases with the square of its distance from the observer, mathematically represented as:

$$
b \propto \frac{L}{d^2}
$$

where $ b $ is the apparent brightness, $ L $ is the intrinsic luminosity, and $ d $ is the distance.

Over the years, the accuracy of this distance measurement method has been significantly enhanced through the use of advanced instruments and techniques, including parallax measurements and observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. Cepheid variable stars have been instrumental in determining distances to nearby galaxies and have played a vital role in expanding our understanding of the size and age of the universe.
