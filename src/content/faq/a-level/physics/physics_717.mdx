An antiparticle is defined as a particle that possesses the same mass as its corresponding particle but has an opposite charge.

To elaborate, antiparticles share the same mass with their corresponding particles, yet their electric charges are reversed. For instance, the antiparticle of an electron is known as a positron. While both have an identical mass, the positron carries a positive charge, in contrast to the electron's negative charge. Similarly, the antiparticle of a proton is called an antiproton, which has the same mass as a proton but carries a negative charge.

The existence of antiparticles was first theorized by Paul Dirac in 1928, stemming from his work on relativistic quantum theory concerning the electron. This theory predicted the existence of antiparticles, which was experimentally confirmed in 1932 when Carl Anderson identified the positron in cosmic rays.

When a particle encounters its corresponding antiparticle, they can annihilate each other, resulting in the release of energy in the form of gamma rays. This annihilation process is utilized in positron emission tomography (PET) scans, which provide valuable images of the internal structures of the body.

Antimatter, which consists of antiparticles, is exceedingly rare in the universe. However, it can be generated in particle accelerators. The exploration of antimatter is crucial for gaining insights into the fundamental nature of matter and energy, as well as for the advancement of innovative technologies, including antimatter propulsion systems for space travel.
