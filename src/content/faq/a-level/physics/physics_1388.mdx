The valence and conduction bands in semiconductors play a crucial role in determining their electrical conductivity.

Semiconductors are materials with electrical conductivity that lies between that of conductors and insulators. The valence band represents the highest energy level where electrons are typically found at absolute zero temperature. This band is filled with electrons that are tightly bound to the atoms within the crystal lattice. In contrast, the conduction band is the lowest energy band that remains unoccupied at absolute zero. The valence band and conduction band are separated by an energy gap known as the band gap.

When an external energy source, such as heat or light, is applied to the semiconductor, it can excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, thereby creating vacancies known as holes in the valence band. The movement of these electrons and holes through the semiconductor facilitates electrical conductivity.

The size of the band gap is a critical factor in determining the electrical conductivity of a semiconductor. In materials with a small band gap, like silicon, the thermal energy is sufficient to excite electrons across the band gap, enabling conductivity. Conversely, in materials with a larger band gap, such as diamond, a greater amount of energy is required to promote electrons across the band gap to achieve electrical conductivity.

In conclusion, the valence and conduction bands are fundamental to the electrical conductivity of semiconductors. The ability of electrons and holes to move through the semiconductor is what allows for electrical conduction, while the size of the band gap dictates the energy necessary for this movement to occur.
