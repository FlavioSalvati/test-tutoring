The energy of a system is influenced by the work performed on it, as work represents a transfer of energy.

When work is done on a system, energy is transferred into the system, resulting in an increase in its energy. This relationship can be expressed by the equation:

$$
W = \Delta E
$$

where $W$ denotes the work done on the system and $\Delta E$ represents the change in the system's energy. Conversely, when a system does work, energy is transferred out of the system, leading to a decrease in its energy.

The nature of the work performed on a system can also influence the form of energy transfer. For instance, when work is applied to compress a gas in a piston, the internal energy of the gas increases due to the work done. On the other hand, if an object is acted upon by a gravitational force, the work done can result in an increase in its gravitational potential energy.

It is crucial to recognize that energy within a system is conserved, implying that the total energy of the system remains constant. Consequently, any increase or decrease in energy resulting from work done must be counterbalanced by an equal and opposite change in energy within the system or its surroundings.

In summary, the energy of a system is altered by the work done, which serves as a mechanism for energy transfer. The type of work executed and the resulting energy transfer can vary based on the specific system and its environment. Nonetheless, the total energy of the system remains invariant due to the principle of energy conservation.
