Radiation therapy employs high-energy radiation to eliminate cancer cells and reduce tumor size.

The mechanism of radiation therapy involves damaging the DNA within cancer cells, thereby inhibiting their ability to divide and proliferate. This radiation is directed at the tumor site using a device known as a linear accelerator, which targets the tumor with radiation beams from various angles. The primary objective is to deliver a substantial dose of radiation to the tumor while minimizing exposure to the surrounding healthy tissue.

There are two principal types of radiation therapy: external beam radiation therapy and internal radiation therapy. External beam radiation therapy utilizes a machine positioned outside the body to administer radiation to the tumor. In contrast, internal radiation therapy, commonly referred to as brachytherapy, involves implanting a radioactive source directly within the body, close to the tumor.

Typically, radiation therapy is administered in daily sessions over several weeks. The duration of the treatment and the amount of radiation prescribed depend on various factors, including the type and stage of cancer, as well as the overall health of the patient.

While radiation therapy can be an effective treatment for cancer, it may also lead to side effects such as fatigue, skin irritation, and nausea. Fortunately, these side effects are generally temporary and can be managed with appropriate medication and lifestyle adjustments. Overall, radiation therapy serves as a vital component in the battle against cancer, significantly enhancing the quality of life for many patients.
