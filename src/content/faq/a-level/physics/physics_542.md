Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans function by detecting gamma rays that are emitted from a radioactive tracer injected into the body. 

The radioactive tracer is typically a molecule analogous to substances that the body naturally utilizes, such as glucose. Once injected, the tracer circulates through the body and emits positrons, which are positively charged particles. When a positron encounters an electron within the body, the two particles annihilate each other, resulting in the production of gamma raysâ€”high-energy photons. These gamma rays are then detected by the PET scanner, which employs specialized detectors to measure the emitted radiation from the body.

Using the data collected from these gamma rays, the PET scanner constructs a three-dimensional image of the body. This image highlights areas where the tracer has accumulated, indicating regions of heightened metabolic activity. Such information is invaluable for diagnosing and monitoring various conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders.

PET scans are an essential tool in medical imaging as they provide insights into the functional aspects of organs and tissues, rather than merely their structural characteristics. However, it is important to note that PET scans involve exposure to radiation, which may not be suitable for everyone. Therefore, they should only be conducted when deemed necessary by a healthcare professional.
