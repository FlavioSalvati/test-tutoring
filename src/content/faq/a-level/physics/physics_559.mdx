Hadrons are subatomic particles that consist of quarks, which are bound together by the strong nuclear force. 

Hadrons can be classified into two main categories: baryons and mesons. Baryons are composed of three quarks, whereas mesons consist of one quark paired with one antiquark.

Some common examples of baryons include protons and neutrons, which serve as the fundamental constituents of atomic nuclei. Additionally, there are hyperons, a subgroup of baryons that contain one or more strange quarks. Mesons, on the other hand, include pions, the lightest meson, and kaons, which incorporate strange quarks.

The study of hadrons is crucial in the field of particle physics, as they are directly influenced by the strong nuclear forceâ€”one of the four fundamental forces of nature. This force is essential for maintaining the stability of atomic nuclei and governs the interactions between quarks within hadrons.

Beyond their significance in theoretical physics, hadrons have practical applications in various fields, including medicine and energy. For instance, proton therapy is an innovative cancer treatment that employs beams of protons to precisely target and destroy cancer cells. Similarly, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a sophisticated particle accelerator designed to investigate the properties of hadrons and other subatomic particles.
