A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner is a sophisticated medical imaging device that detects gamma rays emitted from a patient's body following the injection of a radioactive tracer.

PET is a powerful imaging technique utilized to visualize the metabolic activity of cells within the body. It plays a crucial role in diagnosing and treating various medical conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders. After the radioactive tracer is administered, it is metabolized by the body and emits positrons, which are positively charged particles. When a positron encounters an electron, the two annihilate each other, resulting in the release of two gamma rays that travel in opposite directions. These gamma rays are detected by the PET scanner, which then uses the data to create detailed images of the body's internal structures.

The PET scanner is composed of a ring of detectors that encircle the patient. Each detector consists of a scintillator crystal paired with a photomultiplier tube. When a gamma ray strikes the scintillator crystal, it generates a burst of light. This light is then amplified by the photomultiplier tube and transformed into an electrical signal that can be processed by a computer. By analyzing the time difference between the detections of the two gamma rays, the PET scanner accurately determines the location of the tracer within the body.

Subsequently, the computer processes this data to produce a three-dimensional image that illustrates the distribution of the tracer, reflecting the metabolic activity of cells in various regions. PET scans are frequently combined with computed tomography (CT) scans to yield more comprehensive images. The integration of PET and CT, known as PET/CT scans, aids physicians in diagnosing and monitoring the progression of diseases, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of treatments.
