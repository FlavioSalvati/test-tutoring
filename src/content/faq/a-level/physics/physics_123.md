The trajectory of a charged particle in a magnetic field is governed by the Lorentz force.

When a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force that is perpendicular to both its velocity and the direction of the magnetic field. This force, known as the Lorentz force, can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}),
$$

where $q$ represents the charge of the particle, $\mathbf{v}$ is its velocity vector, and $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field vector.

To determine the direction of the Lorentz force, we can use the right-hand rule. If you point your right thumb in the direction of the particle's velocity and curl your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, your palm will face in the direction of the force acting on the particle.

The magnitude of the Lorentz force is influenced by the charge of the particle, its velocity, and the strength of the magnetic field. In the case of a uniform magnetic field, the charged particle will follow a circular path. The radius of this circular path can be calculated using the formula:

$$
r = \frac{mv}{qB},
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the particle.

If the magnetic field is non-uniform, the particle will encounter a force that varies in both direction and magnitude as it traverses the field. Consequently, the path taken by the particle will be more intricate and may require numerical methods or approximations for accurate description.

In summary, the trajectory of a charged particle in a magnetic field is dictated by the Lorentz force, which is dependent on the particle's charge, velocity, and the magnetic field strength. The direction of the force is determined using the right-hand rule, and the particle's path may be circular or more complex, depending on whether the magnetic field is uniform or non-uniform.
