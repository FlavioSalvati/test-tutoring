X-rays are generated when high-energy electrons collide with a metal target.

When a high-energy electron strikes a metal target, it can transfer some of its energy to an inner-shell electron within a metal atom. This transfer of energy can result in the ejection of the inner-shell electron from the atom, creating a vacancy in the inner shell. Subsequently, an outer-shell electron fills this vacancy, releasing energy in the form of an X-ray photon.

The energy of the emitted X-ray photon is determined by the difference in energy between the inner-shell and outer-shell electrons involved in the transition. This difference is referred to as the binding energy of the electron, which varies depending on the specific element of the metal target.

In addition to collisions with metal targets, X-rays can also be produced through other mechanisms, such as synchrotron radiation. This process involves accelerating electrons to speeds close to that of light and then bending their trajectory using magnetic fields. This results in a highly intense beam of X-rays, which can be utilized for advanced scientific research.

X-rays have a wide array of applications, particularly in medical imaging. They are capable of penetrating soft tissues, allowing for the visualization of bones and internal organs. However, it is important to note that exposure to elevated levels of X-rays can be detrimental to health, as they may damage DNA and induce mutations that could lead to cancer. Therefore, it is essential to implement safety measures, such as appropriate shielding and limiting exposure time, when working with X-ray equipment.
