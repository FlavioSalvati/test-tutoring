Radioactive decay can be categorized into three primary types: alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay.

**Alpha Decay** occurs when an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. As a result of this emission, the atomic number decreases by $2$, and the mass number decreases by $4$. This process leads to the transformation of the original element into a new element that is positioned two places back on the periodic table.

**Beta Decay** takes place when a neutron within the nucleus transforms into a proton while emitting an electron (known as a beta particle). This transformation increases the atomic number by $1$, while the mass number remains unchanged. Consequently, the original element is converted into a different element that is one position forward on the periodic table.

**Gamma Decay** involves the release of energy from a nucleus in an excited state, which emits this energy in the form of gamma rays. Notably, gamma decay does not alter the atomic number or the mass number of the nucleus; it merely results in a transition to a lower energy state.

In addition to these main types of decay, there are other less common forms, such as positron emission and electron capture. The specific type of decay that occurs is determined by the stability of the nucleus and the interplay between the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force. 

A comprehensive understanding of the various types of radioactive decay is crucial in several fields, including nuclear physics, medicine, and environmental science.
