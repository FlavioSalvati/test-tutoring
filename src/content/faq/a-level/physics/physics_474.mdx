The formula for elastic potential energy is expressed as 

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$ 

where \( E \) represents the elastic potential energy, \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the displacement from the equilibrium position.

Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in an object when it is either stretched or compressed. This energy is directly proportional to both the degree of deformation and the stiffness of the object. The formula for elastic potential energy is derived from Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is directly proportional to its displacement from its equilibrium position. The proportionality constant in this relationship is known as the spring constant \( k \).

The elastic potential energy formula can be succinctly stated as 

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$ 

In this equation, \( E \) denotes the elastic potential energy, \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the displacement from the equilibrium position. The factor of \( \frac{1}{2} \) is significant because it accounts for the fact that the force exerted by the spring is proportional to its displacement, leading to energy being stored according to the square of the displacement.

This formula can be utilized to calculate the elastic potential energy stored in springs, as well as in other elastic materials, such as rubber bands and bungee cords.
