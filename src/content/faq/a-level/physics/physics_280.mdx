Centripetal force can be determined using the formula 

$$
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$ 

where \( F_c \) represents the centripetal force.

In the context of circular motion, an object travels along a circular path at a constant speed. The force responsible for maintaining this circular motion is known as the centripetal force. This force acts toward the center of the circle and is always perpendicular to the object's velocity. The magnitude of the centripetal force depends on three factors: the mass of the object, its speed, and the radius of the circular path.

The centripetal force formula is given by 

$$
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$ 

In this equation, \( m \) signifies the mass of the object, \( v \) denotes the object's speed, and \( r \) represents the radius of the circle. This relationship indicates that the centripetal force is directly proportional to both the mass of the object and the square of its speed, while being inversely proportional to the radius of the circular path.

It is crucial to understand that centripetal force is not a distinct type of force; rather, it results from other forces acting on the object. For instance, when a car turns a corner, the centripetal force arises from the friction between the tires and the road. Similarly, for a satellite in orbit around the Earth, the gravitational force between the satellite and the Earth provides the necessary centripetal force.

In summary, the centripetal force is calculated using the formula 

$$
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}
$$ 

and it depends on the mass, speed, and radius of the object moving in a circular path.
