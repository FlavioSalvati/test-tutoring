A gamma camera is an essential instrument in nuclear medicine, designed to detect gamma rays emitted by radioactive isotopes within the body.

In practice, these isotopes are typically introduced into the patient either through injection or ingestion, after which they are absorbed by the bodyâ€™s tissues. The gamma camera plays a crucial role by detecting the gamma rays emitted from these isotopes, allowing it to generate an image that illustrates the distribution of the isotopes throughout the body.

The core component of the gamma camera is a crystal scintillator, which converts gamma rays into visible light. This light is then captured by photomultiplier tubes, which amplify the light signal and transform it into an electrical signal. The processed electrical signal is subsequently analyzed by a computer to produce a detailed image.

The operation of the gamma camera is grounded in the principle that various tissues in the body absorb and emit gamma rays to differing extents. By capturing the gamma rays emitted from the isotopes, the gamma camera can create an image that reveals the distribution of these isotopes. This imaging capability is invaluable for diagnosing a range of medical conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders.

In summary, the gamma camera is a vital tool in nuclear medicine, enabling healthcare professionals to detect and diagnose various medical conditions by visualizing the distribution of radioactive isotopes within the body.
