title: "How does a capacitor behave in a DC circuit initially?"
summary: "In a DC circuit, a capacitor initially functions as an open circuit, preventing current flow until it charges, after which it can store and release energy."

In a direct current (DC) circuit, a capacitor initially acts as an open circuit.

When a DC voltage is applied to a capacitor, it begins to charge until the voltage across its plates equals the applied voltage. During this charging phase, the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, which means that no current flows through it. This occurs because the capacitor serves as a temporary storage device for electric charge, and it requires time for the charge to accumulate on its plates.
