X-rays are significantly more effective at imaging bones than soft tissues, primarily because they are absorbed more readily by dense materials.

X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation capable of penetrating both soft tissues and bones. However, different materials absorb X-rays in varying amounts. Dense materials, such as bones, absorb a greater quantity of X-rays compared to soft tissues, which leads to higher contrast images. The reason for this difference lies in the interaction of X-rays with the electrons in the atoms of the materials they traverse. Dense materials contain a larger number of electrons, resulting in a higher absorption of X-rays and consequently appearing whiter on the imaging results.

Conversely, soft tissues have a lower electron density, which means they absorb fewer X-rays. This results in images with lower contrast, where soft tissues typically appear gray. To enhance the contrast in soft tissue imaging, contrast agents can be employed. These substances are injected into the body to increase the absorption of X-rays by the soft tissues, thereby improving the overall image quality.

In conclusion, X-rays excel at imaging bones compared to soft tissues due to their greater absorption by dense materials. The higher electron density in bones leads to increased X-ray absorption, producing images with greater contrast. In contrast, soft tissues, having fewer electrons, absorb fewer X-rays, resulting in images with lower contrast.
