The cosmic distance ladder is a systematic series of techniques employed by astronomers to measure distances across the universe.

This "ladder" metaphor represents how each method builds upon its predecessor, enabling astronomers to ascertain distances to objects that are progressively farther away. The first step on this ladder is **parallax**, which refers to the apparent shift in the position of a nearby star when observed from different vantage points in Earth's orbit. By measuring the angle of this shift, astronomers can compute the distance to the star using the formula:

$$
d = \frac{1 \text{ AU}}{\tan(\theta)}
$$

where $d$ is the distance to the star, $1 \text{ AU}$ is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, and $\theta$ is the angle of parallax.

The next rung involves the concept of **standard candles**, which are astronomical objects with a known luminosity. By comparing the intrinsic brightness of a standard candle to its observed brightness, astronomers can calculate its distance. Notable examples of standard candles include **Cepheid variables**, which are pulsating stars that exhibit a well-defined relationship between their period and luminosity, and **Type Ia supernovae**, which have a consistent peak brightness.

At the top of the cosmic distance ladder is the method of **cosmological redshift**. This phenomenon occurs when light waves from distant galaxies are stretched due to the expansion of the universe. By measuring the redshift $z$ of these galaxies, astronomers can infer their distances and derive the universe's expansion rate using the relation:

$$
d = \frac{c}{H_0} \times \frac{z}{1+z}
$$

where $c$ is the speed of light and $H_0$ is the Hubble constant.

The cosmic distance ladder is a crucial instrument in astronomy, enabling the measurement of the universe's size and age, as well as distances to various celestial objects such as stars, galaxies, and quasars. However, each technique comes with its own limitations and uncertainties. As a result, astronomers must meticulously analyze their data to ensure the accuracy of their distance measurements.
