The electric field inside a conductor is always zero in electrostatic equilibrium.

When an external electric field is applied to a conductor, the free electrons within the conductor respond by moving in such a way as to counteract the applied field. This movement of charge leads to the creation of an internal electric field that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the external electric field. Consequently, the net electric field inside the conductor becomes zero.

This phenomenon is referred to as electrostatic shielding, which explains why conductors are often employed to protect sensitive electronic equipment from external electric fields. Additionally, the absence of an electric field within the conductor ensures that any excess charge resides on its surface in a uniform distribution.

It is crucial to understand that the condition of zero electric field within a conductor applies only when the conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium. If the external electric field changes, the charge distribution within the conductor will adjust to neutralize the new field. This means that a non-zero electric field may temporarily exist inside the conductor until a new equilibrium state is achieved.

In summary, the electric field inside a conductor remains zero in electrostatic equilibrium due to the redistribution of charges that effectively cancels out any external electric field.
