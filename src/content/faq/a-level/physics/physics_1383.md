Acceleration due to gravity refers to the rate at which an object falls toward the Earth. 

The acceleration due to gravity, commonly represented by the symbol $g$, has a standard value of $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$ at the Earth's surface. This indicates that any object dropped or thrown near the surface of the Earth will accelerate downward at a rate of $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$. This value is derived from the mass of the Earth and the distance from the object to the Earth's center.

The concept of acceleration due to gravity is fundamental in physics and plays a crucial role in various calculations, such as determining the speed and distance of falling objects. It is also significant in the study of gravitational forces and the motion of celestial bodies.

It is essential to understand that the acceleration due to gravity is not uniform across the universe. It varies based on the mass of the celestial body and the distance from its center. For instance, the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Moon is approximately $1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2$, which is considerably less than that on Earth.

In summary, the acceleration due to gravity is a vital concept in physics that describes how objects move near the Earth's surface. With a constant value of $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$, it is integral to many calculations and studies within the field of physics.
