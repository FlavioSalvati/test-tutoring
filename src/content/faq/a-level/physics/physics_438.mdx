To determine the electric field generated by a ring of charge, we apply Coulomb's Law and perform an integration.

The electric field at a point along the axis of the charged ring can be calculated by examining a small charge element, denoted as $dq$, located on the ring. According to Coulomb's Law, the electric field produced by this charge element at the specified point on the axis is expressed as:

$$
dE = \frac{k \, dq}{r^2}
$$

Here, $k$ is the Coulomb constant, $dq$ represents the charge of the infinitesimal element, and $r$ denotes the distance from this charge element to the point on the axis.

To obtain the total electric field at the point on the axis, we must integrate this expression over the entire ring. The resulting electric field can be expressed as:

$$
E = \int dE = \frac{k \, q \, z}{(z^2 + R^2)^{3/2}}
$$

In this equation, $q$ represents the total charge distributed around the ring, $R$ is the radius of the ring, and $z$ is the distance from the center of the ring to the point along the axis.

It's important to note that this expression for the electric field is specifically valid only along the axis of the ring. If you wish to calculate the electric field at a point that is not on the axis, you will need to utilize a more comprehensive expression, such as that for a disk of charge.
