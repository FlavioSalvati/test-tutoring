Electrical conductors facilitate the flow of electricity, while insulators restrict or inhibit this flow.

Electrical conductors are materials that permit electric current to pass through them with ease. They exhibit low resistance to electrical flow and are typically composed of metals such as copper, silver, and aluminum. These conductive materials possess free electrons that can move freely in response to an applied voltage. The movement of these electrons is what enables the flow of electric current.

In contrast, insulators are materials that impede or limit the passage of electric current. They demonstrate high resistance to electrical flow and are often made from substances like rubber, glass, and plastic. In insulators, the electrons are tightly bound to the atoms of the material, preventing them from moving freely when a voltage is applied. This characteristic makes it challenging for electric current to flow through these materials.

The capacity of a material to conduct electricity or serve as an insulator is quantified by its electrical conductivity. This property measures how readily electric current can traverse the material. Materials with high electrical conductivity are classified as good conductors, while those with low electrical conductivity are regarded as effective insulators.

In summary, electrical conductors enable the flow of electric current, whereas insulators restrict or limit this flow. The conductivity of a material is the key factor that determines whether it functions as a conductor or an insulator.
