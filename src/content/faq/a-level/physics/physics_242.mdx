To calculate electrical power in a circuit, you multiply the voltage by the current.

Electrical power is defined as the rate at which electrical energy is transferred or converted into other forms of energy. It is measured in watts (W) and can be calculated using the formula:

$$
P = VI
$$

where $P$ represents power, $V$ is voltage, and $I$ is current.

Voltage is the potential difference between two points in a circuit and is measured in volts (V). Current, on the other hand, refers to the flow of electric charge through the circuit, measured in amperes (A). To determine the power in a circuit, you need to know both the voltage and the current values.

For instance, consider a circuit with a voltage of $12 \, V$ and a current of $2 \, A$. The power can be calculated by multiplying the voltage by the current:

$$
P = 12 \, V \times 2 \, A = 24 \, W
$$

This calculation indicates that the circuit transfers or converts $24 \, J$ (joules) of electrical energy per second.

It is also important to recognize that electrical power can be either positive or negative, depending on the direction of current flow and the polarity of the voltage. For example, in a circuit powered by a battery, power will be positive when the current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, and negative when the current flows in the opposite direction.
