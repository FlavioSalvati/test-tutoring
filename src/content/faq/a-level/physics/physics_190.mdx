A converging mirror focuses light rays to a single point, while a diverging mirror causes them to spread out.

Converging mirrors, often referred to as concave mirrors, feature a curved surface that bulges inward. When light rays strike the surface of a concave mirror, they are reflected inward and converge at a specific point known as the focal point. The distance from the mirror to this focal point is termed the focal length. Converging mirrors find common applications in telescopes, cameras, and automotive headlights.

In contrast, diverging mirrors, also called convex mirrors, have a surface that bulges outward. When light rays hit a convex mirror, they are reflected outward, resulting in a divergence of the rays. The focal point of a diverging mirror is considered imaginary, as the reflected rays do not actually meet at a point. Diverging mirrors are frequently utilized in rear-view mirrors and security mirrors due to their ability to provide a wider field of view.

The primary distinction between converging and diverging mirrors lies in their curvature and the manner in which they reflect light. Converging mirrors focus light rays to a single point, whereas diverging mirrors spread them out. This difference in behavior is attributable to the mirrors' shapes: converging mirrors possess a concave form, while diverging mirrors exhibit a convex form. Understanding the characteristics of converging and diverging mirrors is crucial for the study of optics and the design of optical devices.
