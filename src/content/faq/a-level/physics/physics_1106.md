An electromagnetic field changes over time due to the movement of electric charges and the variation of magnetic fields.

Electromagnetic fields are generated by the motion of charges and the change in magnetic fields. As electric charges move, they produce electric fields, while variations in magnetic fields lead to the creation of magnetic fields. These fields are interrelated and can propagate through space as electromagnetic waves.

The temporal variation of an electromagnetic field can be characterized by its frequency and wavelength. The frequency of an electromagnetic wave, measured in Hertz (Hz), indicates the number of oscillations per second. The wavelength, measured in meters (m), is defined as the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs of the wave.

Electromagnetic waves encompass a broad spectrum of frequencies, ranging from radio waves, which typically have frequencies around $10^3$ Hz, to gamma rays, with frequencies reaching approximately $10^{19}$ Hz. In a vacuum, the speed of electromagnetic waves is constant at $3 \times 10^8$ m/s, commonly referred to as the speed of light.

Understanding the time-dependent variation of electromagnetic fields is crucial in various fields of physics, including electromagnetism, optics, and quantum mechanics. A thorough comprehension of how these fields fluctuate over time is essential for grasping the principles underlying light, electricity, and magnetism.
