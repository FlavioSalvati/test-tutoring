Angular velocity refers to the rate at which angular displacement changes with respect to time.

In the context of circular motion, an object travels along a circular path at a constant speed. Despite maintaining this constant speed, the object's direction is in constant flux, leading to a continuous change in its angular displacement. Angular velocity quantifies this change in angular displacement per unit of time. It is a vector quantity, commonly expressed in radians per second (rad/s).

The direction of the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of motion and adheres to the right-hand rule. Specifically, if the object moves in a clockwise direction, the angular velocity vector points downward; conversely, if the motion is anticlockwise, the vector points upward.

Furthermore, angular velocity is intrinsically linked to linear velocity, which measures the rate of change of linear displacement over time. The two quantities are connected through the radius of the circular path. The relationship is defined by the equation:

$$
v = r\omega
$$

where $v$ represents the linear velocity, $r$ denotes the radius of the circular path, and $\omega$ is the angular velocity.

In summary, angular velocity serves as a measure of the rate of change of angular displacement and is fundamentally related to circular motion via the radius of the circular path.
