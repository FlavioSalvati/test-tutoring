Quarks are fundamental particles that serve as the building blocks of protons and neutrons, which in turn constitute atoms. There are six distinct types of quarks, commonly referred to as "flavours": up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Each quark has an associated antiparticle that possesses an opposite charge.

The up and down quarks are the most prevalent, forming the majority of protons and neutrons. In contrast, charm and strange quarks are heavier and less stable, typically appearing in high-energy particle collisions. The top and bottom quarks are the heaviest among them and have the shortest lifetimes, being produced only in extremely high-energy environments.

Quarks exhibit a property known as "spin," which can be categorized as either "up" or "down." This intrinsic property influences how quarks interact with one another and with other particles. Notably, quarks are never found in isolation; they combine in groups of two or three to form particles called "hadrons." Protons and neutrons are prime examples of hadrons composed of quarks.

The investigation of quarks and their interactions is a significant focus of research in the field of particle physics. Gaining a deeper understanding of quark properties and behaviours is crucial for unraveling the fundamental nature of matter and the universe itself.
