To calculate the work done by a variable force, you must integrate the force over the displacement.

When a constant force acts on an object, the work done can be computed by multiplying the force by the displacement and the cosine of the angle between them. However, this approach is not applicable for variable forces. In such cases, the work done is determined by integrating the force over the displacement.

The process involves dividing the total displacement into small intervals and calculating the work done by the force over each of these intervals. You can then sum all these small amounts of work to obtain the total work done by the force.

The formula that represents the work done by a variable force is given by:

$$
W = \int F(x) \, dx
$$

Here, $F(x)$ denotes the force as a function of the displacement $x$. To evaluate this integral, you can use various calculus techniques, such as substitution or integration by parts.

It's crucial to remember that work is only done when the displacement is in the same direction as the force. If the force and displacement are perpendicular, no work is performed. Conversely, if they are in opposite directions, the work done is negative.

In summary, to compute the work done by a variable force, you need to integrate the force over the displacement. This requires dividing the displacement into small intervals and summing the work done across each interval. Remember that for work to be done, the displacement must align with the direction of the force.
