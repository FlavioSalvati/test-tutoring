Newton's laws of motion apply to gravitational interactions just as they do to any other type of motion.

When an object is influenced by gravity, it experiences a force known as weight. This force is directly proportional to the object's mass and the acceleration due to gravity. According to Newton's second law, the force acting on an object is given by the equation:

$$
F = m \cdot a
$$

where $F$ represents the force, $m$ is the mass of the object, and $a$ is its acceleration. Consequently, the same equation can be employed to describe the motion of an object under the influence of gravity, just as it would for any other form of motion.

Furthermore, Newton's third law is also relevant in the context of gravitational motion. When an object is attracted toward the Earth, the Earth exerts an equal and opposite force on the object. This interaction is termed the gravitational force and is articulated through Newton's law of gravitation.

Lastly, Newton's first law, commonly referred to as the law of inertia, is applicable to motion influenced by gravity as well. An object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by an external force. Similarly, an object in motion will continue to move in a straight line at a constant speed unless a net external force is applied. For example, if an object is thrown upward, it will ascend until the force of gravity eventually pulls it back down.

In summary, Newton's laws of motion are applicable to gravitational interactions just as they are to any other forms of motion. The force of gravity is quantified using Newton's law of gravitation, while the motion of an object under the influence of gravity can be described by Newton's second law. Finally, Newton's first law governs the behavior of objects at rest and in motion in a gravitational field.
