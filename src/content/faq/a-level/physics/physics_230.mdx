To calculate the work done in lifting a load, you need to multiply the force exerted by the distance the load is lifted.

When lifting an object, work is performed against the force of gravity. The amount of work done can be mathematically represented as:

$$
W = F \times d
$$

In this equation, $W$ represents the work done, $F$ denotes the force applied, and $d$ signifies the distance lifted.

The force applied in this context is equivalent to the weight of the load being lifted. The weight can be calculated using the formula:

$$
F = m \times g
$$

Here, $F$ is the force, $m$ is the mass of the load, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$ on Earth. For instance, if the load has a mass of $10 \, \text{kg}$, the force applied would be:

$$
F = 10 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 98.1 \, \text{N}
$$

The distance lifted ($d$) is the vertical distance from the starting point to the endpoint of the lift, and it can be measured in meters or centimeters, depending on the required precision.

Once you have determined both the force and the distance, you can calculate the work done in lifting the load by multiplying these two values. For example, if a $10 \, \text{kg}$ load is lifted a distance of $2 \, \text{m}$, the work done can be calculated as follows:

$$
W = 98.1 \, \text{N} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 196.2 \, \text{J}
$$

It is important to understand that the work done in lifting a load is equal to the potential energy gained by the load. This potential energy can subsequently be converted into kinetic energy when the load is lowered or moved horizontally.
