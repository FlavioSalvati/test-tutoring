Superconductors are remarkable materials that exhibit zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism when cooled below a specific temperature known as the critical temperature, denoted as $T_c$. This unique phenomenon is referred to as superconductivity. In addition to their ability to conduct electricity without resistance, superconductors are characterized by their complete repulsion of magnetic fields.

The critical temperature varies significantly among different superconducting materials, typically falling below $-200^\circ C$. However, advancements in materials science have led to the discovery of high-temperature superconductors, which can maintain superconductivity at temperatures exceeding $-100^\circ C$.

Superconductors have a wide range of applications, including in technologies such as MRI machines, particle accelerators, and efficient power transmission systems. Despite their potential, the requirement for extremely low operating temperatures poses challenges, making large-scale use both difficult and expensive.

The phenomenon of superconductivity is explained by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. This theory describes how electrons can form pairs, known as Cooper pairs, and move through the material without encountering resistance. This pairing occurs due to interactions between electrons and lattice vibrations, referred to as phonons.

Beyond their practical applications, superconductors also captivate physicists, providing valuable insights into the quantum realm. They are currently being explored for their potential applications in quantum computing, a development that could transform the landscape of computing technology.
