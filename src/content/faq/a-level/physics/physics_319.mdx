Wave refraction refers to the bending of waves as they transition from one medium to another.

When waves encounter a change in the medium they are traveling through—such as moving from deep water to shallow water—their speed is altered. This change in speed results in the waves bending, or refracting, toward the normal line, which is an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface of the new medium. The degree of bending is influenced by the angle of incidence, which is the angle at which the wave approaches the boundary between the two media.

For instance, when waves approach a coastline, refraction can lead to the waves bending around headlands and into bays. This phenomenon can create areas of calm water within the bays, while the headlands may experience more intense wave action. Additionally, wave refraction can cause waves to converge or diverge, depending on the specific shape of the coastline.

Understanding wave refraction is crucial for coastal engineering and management. By comprehending how waves behave as they approach a coastline, engineers can design effective structures, such as breakwaters and jetties, to protect shorelines from erosion and flooding. Furthermore, this knowledge aids in making informed decisions regarding the placement of coastal developments and infrastructure, including ports and marinas.
