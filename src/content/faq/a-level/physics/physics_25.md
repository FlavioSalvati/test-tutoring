Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation.

Pulsars are formed when a massive star undergoes a supernova explosion, leading to the collapse of its core into a neutron star. These neutron stars possess extraordinary density, with a mass greater than that of the Sun, yet compressed into a sphere only a few kilometers in diameter. Furthermore, pulsars are characterized by their intense magnetic fields, which can be trillions of times stronger than Earth's magnetic field.

As pulsars rotate, they emit beams of electromagnetic radiation from their magnetic poles. However, these beams are not emitted uniformly; instead, they form a narrow cone that sweeps across space as the pulsar spins. If Earth is positioned within the path of one of these beams, we observe a pulse of radiation each time the beam passes our planet.

The emission rate of pulsar pulses is remarkably regular, with some pulsars generating hundreds of pulses per second. This consistency arises from the neutron star's stable rotation, which is maintained by the conservation of angular momentum. Any fluctuations in the rotation rate of a pulsar can be detected as variations in the timing of its pulses. This property makes pulsars valuable tools for studying the characteristics of neutron stars and the effects of gravity.
