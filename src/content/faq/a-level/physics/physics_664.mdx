The magnifying power of a microscope is fundamentally based on the principles of refraction and the configuration of lens systems.

Microscopes employ lenses to enlarge small objects, such as cells or bacteria, making them visible to the human eye. The magnifying power of a microscope is determined by the specific combination of lenses utilized in its design. These lenses collaborate to bend and focus light, enabling the viewer to observe the object with increased detail.

Refraction is a crucial principle in understanding the magnifying capabilities of a microscope. This phenomenon occurs when light travels through materials of different densities, such as air and glass. As light passes from one medium to another, its angle changes, resulting in a bending effect. This bending of light is what allows lenses to achieve magnification.

A typical microscope lens system consists of two primary components: the objective lens and the eyepiece lens. The objective lens, which is situated close to the object being examined, is responsible for generating a magnified image. The eyepiece lens, positioned near the viewer's eye, further magnifies the image produced by the objective lens.

The magnifying power of a microscope can be expressed as the ratio of the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece lenses. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
\text{Magnifying Power} = \frac{f_{e}}{f_{o}}
$$

where $f_{e}$ is the focal length of the eyepiece lens and $f_{o}$ is the focal length of the objective lens. A larger ratio indicates greater magnifying power. However, it is important to note that there is a practical limit to how much a microscope can magnify due to the constraints of the lens system and the wavelength of light being used.
