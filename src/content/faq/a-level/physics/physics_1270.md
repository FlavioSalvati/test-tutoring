An MRI scanner generates a magnetic field using superconducting coils made from niobium-titanium.

MRI scanners utilize a strong magnetic field to align the protons in the hydrogen atoms present in the body. This magnetic field is produced by superconducting coils composed of niobium-titanium, which are cooled to a temperature of $-269^{\circ}\text{C}$ using liquid helium. At this extremely low temperature, the coils enter a superconducting state, enabling them to conduct electricity without any resistance. This property allows a substantial current to flow through the coils, resulting in the creation of a powerful magnetic field.

The strength of the magnetic field is measured in tesla (T), with most MRI scanners operating at either $1.5\,\text{T}$ or $3\,\text{T}$. Generally, the greater the magnetic field strength, the clearer and more detailed the resulting images. However, higher magnetic field strengths necessitate more powerful and costly magnets, as well as more complex cooling systems.

In addition to the primary magnetic field, MRI scanners employ gradient coils to induce small variations in the magnetic field. These variations are essential for spatially encoding the signals received from the body, enabling the scanner to produce intricate three-dimensional images.

In summary, the magnetic field generated by an MRI scanner plays a vital role in the imaging process, facilitating the creation of detailed images of the body's internal structures.
