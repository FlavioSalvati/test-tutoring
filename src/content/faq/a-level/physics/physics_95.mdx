There are four main types of stellar spectra: continuous, absorption, emission, and a combination of absorption and emission.

**Continuous spectra** are produced by hot, dense objects such as stars. They exhibit a smooth and uninterrupted range of colors, covering all wavelengths of visible light.

**Absorption spectra** occur when light from a continuous source passes through a cooler gas. In this process, certain wavelengths of light are absorbed by the gas, resulting in dark lines appearing in the spectrum. These dark lines are characteristic of specific elements, enabling scientists to analyze the composition of stars.

**Emission spectra** arise when atoms in a gas are excited and emit light at particular wavelengths, creating bright lines in the spectrum. This type of spectrum is commonly observed in nebulae and other hot, ionized gases.

**Absorption and emission spectra** represent a combination of the two, displaying both dark and bright lines.

Stellar spectra are essential for gaining insights into the temperature, composition, and motion of stars. By analyzing these spectra, scientists can ascertain the chemical makeup of stars, their surface temperatures, and whether they are moving toward or away from Earth. This information is vital for understanding the evolution and behavior of stars, as well as the formation and structure of galaxies.
