During beta decay, a nucleus emits either a beta particle (an electron) or a beta-plus particle (a positron).

Beta decay is a specific type of radioactive decay that occurs when a nucleus becomes unstable due to an excess of protons or neutrons. This instability leads to the emission of particles. In beta-minus decay, a neutron within the nucleus is transformed into a proton and an electron, with the electron being ejected from the nucleus. Conversely, in beta-plus decay, a proton is converted into a neutron and a positron, which is then emitted from the nucleus.

Additionally, during the beta decay process, the nucleus releases a type of radiation known as a neutrino (or antineutrino). These particles are neutral and possess very little mass, allowing them to interact only weakly with matter. Although they are challenging to detect, their existence has been predicted by theoretical physics and confirmed through experimental evidence.

Beta decay has numerous applications in various fields, particularly in medicine. For instance, in positron emission tomography (PET) scans, a radioactive isotope is introduced into the body, emitting positrons that interact with electrons present in the body. This interaction generates gamma rays, which can be detected by a scanner to create detailed images. Furthermore, in radiation therapy, beta particles are utilized to target and destroy cancer cells while aiming to minimize damage to surrounding healthy tissue.
