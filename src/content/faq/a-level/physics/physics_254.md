The spectral class of a star is intrinsically linked to its temperature and luminosity.

A star's spectral class is primarily determined by its surface temperature, which significantly influences its luminosity. The surface temperature reflects the amount of energy a star emits; hotter stars radiate more energy than their cooler counterparts. This energy is emitted in the form of light, and by analyzing the spectrum of this light, astronomers can accurately classify a star's spectral class.

Stars are categorized into spectral classes designated by letters, with the hottest stars classified as type O and the coolest as type M. The temperature ranges for each spectral class are as follows:

- O: $30,000 - 50,000 \, \text{K}$
- B: $10,000 - 30,000 \, \text{K}$
- A: $7,500 - 10,000 \, \text{K}$
- F: $6,000 - 7,500 \, \text{K}$
- G: $5,200 - 6,000 \, \text{K}$
- K: $3,700 - 5,200 \, \text{K}$
- M: $2,400 - 3,700 \, \text{K}$

In addition to temperature, a star's luminosity is also closely related to its surface temperature; hotter stars tend to be more luminous than cooler ones. This relationship occurs because hotter stars emit greater amounts of energy, making them appear brighter. Luminosity is typically measured in terms of absolute magnitude, which quantifies the total amount of light a star emits.

In summary, a star's spectral class serves as a valuable tool for determining its temperature and luminosity. By examining the spectrum of a starâ€™s light, astronomers can extract essential information about its physical properties and evolutionary history.
