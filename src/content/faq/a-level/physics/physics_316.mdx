Frequency plays a vital role in ultrasound imaging, as it directly influences both resolution and depth of penetration.

Ultrasound imaging employs high-frequency sound waves, typically ranging from $2$ to $18 \, \text{MHz}$, to generate images of internal structures within the body. The frequency of these sound waves is a key determinant of image resolution. Higher frequency waves yield images with enhanced detail, but they are limited by a shallower depth of penetration. Conversely, lower frequency waves can penetrate deeper into the body, although the images produced may lack fine detail.

Additionally, the frequency of the ultrasound waves affects their interaction with various tissues in the body. Softer tissues, such as muscle and fat, tend to absorb and scatter ultrasound waves more than denser tissues, such as bone. As a result, different frequencies are often selected for imaging specific areas of the body, depending on the type of tissue being examined.

Beyond frequency, several other factors—such as the type of transducer used and the specific imaging technique employed—can also impact the quality of ultrasound images. Nevertheless, a solid understanding of frequency's role in ultrasound imaging is essential for optimizing image quality and ensuring accurate diagnoses.
