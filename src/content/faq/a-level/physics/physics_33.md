Temperature influences the kinetic energy of particles, leading to increased motion and randomness in their movement.

As temperature rises, the kinetic energy of particles within a substance also increases. This elevated energy allows particles to move more freely and collide with one another more frequently. Consequently, their motion becomes faster and more chaotic, resulting in an overall increase in the substance's internal energy.

The enhanced motion of particles significantly impacts the physical properties of the substance. For instance, when the temperature of a solid increases, the particles vibrate more vigorously, causing the solid to undergo thermal expansion. In a similar vein, as the temperature of a gas rises, the particles move more rapidly and spread out, leading to an increase in the gas's volume.

Temperature also plays a critical role in the rate of chemical reactions. At elevated temperatures, the increased speed of particles leads to more frequent and energetic collisions, thereby accelerating the reaction rate. However, if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, the energy from collisions can become sufficient to break chemical bonds, potentially slowing down or halting the reaction.

In summary, temperature affects the motion of particles within a substance by increasing their kinetic energy, resulting in faster and more random movement. This change in motion has significant implications for the substance's physical properties and the rate of chemical reactions.
