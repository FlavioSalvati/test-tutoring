### Gravitational Field Inside and Outside a Sphere

Inside a sphere, the gravitational field varies with the distance from the center of the sphere.

When analyzing the gravitational field within a sphere, it is crucial to assume that the mass of the sphere is uniformly distributed. Under this assumption, the gravitational field inside the sphere is directly proportional to the distance from the center. The gravitational force can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
F = \frac{G m(r)}{r^2}
$$

where:
- $F$ represents the gravitational force,
- $G$ is the gravitational constant,
- $m(r)$ is the mass enclosed within a sphere of radius $r$, and
- $r$ is the distance from the center of the sphere.

It is important to note that the gravitational field inside the sphere is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center, which reflects the influence of the mass distribution.

In contrast, outside the sphere, the gravitational field behaves differently. Here, the gravitational field is proportional to the inverse square of the distance from the center of mass of the sphere. For points outside the sphere, we can treat the entire mass of the sphere as though it were concentrated at its center. The gravitational force in this region can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
F = \frac{G m M}{r^2}
$$

where:
- $M$ is the total mass of the sphere,
- $r$ is the distance from the center of mass.

In summary, the gravitational field inside a sphere differs significantly from that outside due to the mass distribution. Inside the sphere, the gravitational field changes with distance from the center, while outside the sphere, it changes with distance from the center of mass.
