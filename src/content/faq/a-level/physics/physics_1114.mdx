To determine the period and frequency of simple harmonic motion, we utilize the following formulas:

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
$$

and 

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}.
$$

### Period of Simple Harmonic Motion

The **period** ($T$) of simple harmonic motion is defined as the time required for one complete oscillation. It is measured in seconds ($s$). The formula for calculating the period is given by:

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}},
$$

where:
- $m$ represents the mass of the object in kilograms ($kg$),
- $k$ is the spring constant measured in newtons per meter ($N/m$).

Importantly, the period is independent of the amplitude of the motion, meaning that changes in the amplitude do not affect the time taken for a complete cycle.

### Frequency of Simple Harmonic Motion

The **frequency** ($f$) of simple harmonic motion indicates the number of oscillations that occur per unit of time. It is measured in hertz ($Hz$). The frequency can be calculated using the formula:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}.
$$

The frequency is directly related to the period and is inversely proportional to it. This relationship implies that as the period increases, the frequency decreases, and vice versa.

### Summary

In summary, to compute the period and frequency of simple harmonic motion, we apply the formulas:

1. $$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$
2. $$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

The period ($T$) represents the time for one complete oscillation and remains unaffected by the amplitude of the motion. Conversely, the frequency ($f$) quantifies the number of oscillations per unit time and is inversely related to the period.
