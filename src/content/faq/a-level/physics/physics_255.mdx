Energy conservation in a radioactive decay process occurs through the conversion of mass into energy.

In a radioactive decay event, an unstable atomic nucleus emits particles or electromagnetic radiation to achieve a more stable state. This transformation involves a change in the energy level of the nucleus, which is accompanied by the release of energy in the form of radiation. The energy released during this process is equal to the difference between the initial and final energy levels of the nucleus.

According to the principle of mass-energy equivalence, energy and mass are interchangeable. Thus, the energy released during radioactive decay corresponds to the mass lost by the nucleus. This relationship is encapsulated in Einstein's renowned equation:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

where $E$ represents energy, $m$ denotes mass, and $c$ is the speed of light.

The conservation of energy in a radioactive decay process is also linked to the conservation of momentum. The emitted particles carry momentum, which must also be conserved. Consequently, the nucleus experiences a recoil in the opposite direction to maintain momentum balance, and the energy associated with this recoil must be factored into the total energy released.

In summary, energy conservation in radioactive decay is achieved through the conversion of mass into energy, as articulated by Einstein's equation. Additionally, the conservation of momentum is significant, as the emitted particles possess momentum that must be conserved throughout the decay process.
