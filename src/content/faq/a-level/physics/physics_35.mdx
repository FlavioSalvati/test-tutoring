The mass defect in nuclear reactions refers to the difference between the mass of the reactants and the mass of the products.

In the course of a nuclear reaction, the total mass of the reactants does not equal the total mass of the products. This discrepancy arises from the conversion of a portion of the mass into energy, as articulated by Einstein's renowned equation, $E=mc^2$. The mass defect, denoted as $\Delta m$, quantifies this difference between the mass of the reactants and the mass of the products, serving as a measure of the mass that has been transformed into energy.

The mass defect can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\Delta m = Z m_p + (A-Z) m_n - m
$$

where:
- $\Delta m$ is the mass defect,
- $Z$ is the atomic number,
- $A$ is the mass number,
- $m_p$ is the mass of a proton,
- $m_n$ is the mass of a neutron, and
- $m$ is the mass of the nucleus.

The mass defect is typically expressed in atomic mass units (amu).

Understanding mass defect is crucial in nuclear physics, as it is directly linked to the binding energy of the nucleus. The binding energy represents the energy required to disassemble the nucleus into its constituent nucleons. This relationship is captured by the equation:

$$
E = \Delta m c^2
$$

The binding energy per nucleon provides insight into the stability of the nucleus; generally, nuclei with higher binding energies per nucleon are more stable.
