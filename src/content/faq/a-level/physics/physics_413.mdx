A white dwarf is composed of a dense core primarily made of carbon and oxygen, which is encased in a thin layer of helium and hydrogen.

White dwarfs are the remnants of stars with low to medium mass that have depleted their nuclear fuel and expelled their outer layers. The core of a white dwarf is extraordinarily dense; its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, yet its radius is only about that of the Earth. This remarkable density arises from the close packing of electrons within the core, which forms a degenerate electron gas that provides the necessary support against gravitational collapse.

The core's primary constituents, carbon and oxygen, are the final products of nuclear fusion processes that occurred during the star's life. In a white dwarf, these elements are so densely packed that they can no longer undergo fusion reactions. As a result, the star ceases to produce energy and no longer emits light.

Surrounding the core, there exists a thin outer layer of helium and hydrogen, remnants of the star's outer envelope prior to its shedding. These layers are relatively cool and contribute minimally to the overall brightness of the star. However, in cases where the white dwarf is part of a binary system and is acquiring material from a companion star, these layers can be heated significantly. This accretion can lead to explosive events such as novae and supernovae.
