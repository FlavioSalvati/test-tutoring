To determine the power output of a lifting machine, you must know both the weight being lifted and the time it takes to lift that weight.

Power quantifies the rate at which work is performed. In the context of a lifting machine, work is accomplished when a weight is elevated against the force of gravity. The formula for calculating power is given by 

$$ P = \frac{W}{t} $$

where \( P \) represents power in watts, \( W \) denotes the work done in joules, and \( t \) indicates the time in seconds. 

To find the work done, you need to consider the weight being lifted and the height to which it is raised. The work formula is expressed as 

$$ W = F \cdot d $$

where \( F \) signifies the force in newtons and \( d \) represents the distance in meters. In the specific case of lifting an object, the force \( F \) corresponds to the weight of the object, while \( d \) is equivalent to the height lifted.

For instance, if a lifting machine elevates a weight of $1000 \, \text{N}$ to a height of $2 \, \text{m}$ in $10 \, \text{s}$, the work done can be calculated as follows:

$$ W = 1000 \, \text{N} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 2000 \, \text{J} $$

Subsequently, the power output can be determined by:

$$ P = \frac{2000 \, \text{J}}{10 \, \text{s}} = 200 \, \text{W} $$

It is crucial to mention that the power calculated using this formula represents the mechanical power of the lifting machine. This calculation does not account for energy losses due to friction or other inefficiencies. Therefore, in practical applications, the actual power needed to lift an object may exceed the computed value.
