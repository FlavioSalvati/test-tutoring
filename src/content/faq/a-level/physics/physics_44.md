Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a sophisticated medical imaging technique that detects gamma rays emitted by positron-emitting radioactive tracers. 

In a typical PET procedure, a radioactive tracer is injected into the patientâ€™s body. As this tracer decays, it emits positrons. When a positron encounters an electron within the body, the two particles annihilate each other, resulting in the release of two gamma rays that travel in opposite directions. A ring of detectors encircling the patient captures these gamma rays, and their detected locations are utilized to construct a three-dimensional image of the tracer's distribution throughout the body.

The detectors employed in a PET scanner are usually composed of scintillating crystals. These crystals produce light when they are struck by gamma rays. This emitted light is then detected by photomultiplier tubes, which amplify the light signal and convert it into an electrical signal suitable for processing by a computer. The computer utilizes advanced algorithms to reconstruct the three-dimensional image of the tracer's distribution within the body.

PET imaging is especially valuable for examining metabolic processes, such as the uptake of glucose by cancer cells. Additionally, it can aid in diagnosing neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, by visualizing the distribution of specific neurotransmitters in the brain. The advent of PET has transformed the field of medical imaging, establishing it as an indispensable tool for diagnosing and treating a wide range of diseases.
