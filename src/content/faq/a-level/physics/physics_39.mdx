Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are two distinct types of nuclear reactions that release substantial amounts of energy, albeit through different mechanisms. 

Nuclear fission involves the splitting of a heavy nucleus into smaller fragments. For example, when a heavy nucleus such as uranium-235 ($^{235}\text{U}$) is bombarded with a neutron, it can undergo fission, resulting in the formation of two smaller nuclei, the release of energy, and the emission of additional neutrons. These emitted neutrons can initiate further fission events in nearby nuclei, leading to a self-sustaining chain reaction. This process is harnessed in nuclear power plants to generate electricity.

On the other hand, nuclear fusion occurs when two light nuclei, such as hydrogen isotopes ($^{2}\text{H}$, deuterium, and $^{3}\text{H}$, tritium), combine to form a heavier nucleus, such as helium ($^{4}\text{He}$). This reaction releases a significant amount of energy and is the fundamental process that powers the sun. However, achieving nuclear fusion on Earth is challenging, as it requires extremely high temperatures and pressures to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged nuclei.

Though both fission and fusion yield large quantities of energy, they come with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Nuclear fission produces radioactive waste that can remain hazardous for thousands of years, posing long-term environmental challenges. In contrast, nuclear fusion generates negligible radioactive waste, making it a more attractive option from an environmental perspective. Despite this advantage, nuclear fusion is not yet a practical energy source due to the considerable technological hurdles that must be overcome to achieve and sustain the necessary conditions for the reaction.
