To calculate the work done in stretching a spring, we use the formula:

$$
W = 0.5 k x^2
$$

In this context, $W$ represents the work done, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position. When a spring is stretched, work is performed on it, resulting in potential energy being stored within the spring.

The spring constant $k$ quantifies the stiffness of the spring and is measured in units of N/m (Newtons per meter). The displacement $x$ indicates how far the spring is stretched from its equilibrium position, measured in meters.

To utilize the formula, you must first determine the spring constant and the displacement. Once you have these values, you can substitute them into the formula to calculate the work done.

It is crucial to note that this formula is applicable only to springs that adhere to Hooke's law. Hooke's law states that the force exerted by a spring is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position. If the spring does not follow Hooke's law, then this formula is not valid for calculating the work done.
