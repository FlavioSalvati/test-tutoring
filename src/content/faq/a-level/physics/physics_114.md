The energy of a system is conserved during a collision, following the principle of conservation of energy.

When two objects collide, the total energy of the system before the collision is equal to the total energy after the collision. This principle states that while energy can be transferred between the colliding objects, the overall energy of the system remains constant.

In an elastic collision, both kinetic energy and momentum are conserved. This means that the objects bounce off each other without any loss of energy. Conversely, in a perfectly inelastic collision, the objects stick together after the impact and move as a single entity. In this scenario, while kinetic energy is not conserved, the total energy of the system is still preserved.

In a partially inelastic collision, some kinetic energy is converted to other forms of energy, such as heat or sound, resulting in energy loss; however, the total energy of the system remains conserved. The extent of energy lost in such collisions depends on the specific characteristics of the collision and the materials involved.

In summary, the conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics that is crucial for understanding the behavior of objects during collisions.
