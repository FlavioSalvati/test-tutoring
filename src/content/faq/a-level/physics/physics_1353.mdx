To analyze an alternating current (AC) circuit utilizing complex numbers, we employ phasors, which effectively represent both the amplitude and phase of the AC voltage and current.

Phasors are complex numbers that encapsulate the amplitude and phase information of an AC voltage or current. We can transform a sinusoidal AC voltage or current into a phasor by determining its complex amplitude—this is the maximum value of the voltage or current—and multiplying it by the complex exponential function $ e^{j\omega t} $, where $ \omega $ denotes the angular frequency of the AC signal.

After converting the AC voltage and current into phasors, we can apply complex arithmetic to analyze the circuit. This enables us to add and subtract phasors to determine the total voltage or current in the circuit. Furthermore, we can apply Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws to ascertain the impedance and current in each component of the circuit.

The impedance of a component in an AC circuit is defined as the ratio of the phasor voltage to the phasor current. It is a complex number that encapsulates both the resistance and reactance of the component. Using the impedance, we can compute the power dissipated by the component, which is calculated as the product of the phasor voltage and the complex conjugate of the phasor current.

In summary, the application of complex numbers in the analysis of AC circuits simplifies the calculation of voltages and currents' amplitudes and phases. It also aids in determining the impedance and power dissipation of each component within the circuit.
