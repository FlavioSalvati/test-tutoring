Type Ia supernovae are pivotal in the field of cosmology, as they serve as standard candles for measuring astronomical distances throughout the universe.

A Type Ia supernova occurs when a white dwarf star in a binary system gathers sufficient mass from its companion star, ultimately surpassing the Chandrasekhar limit. This accumulation triggers a runaway fusion reaction, leading to the complete destruction of the white dwarf. The resulting explosion releases an immense amount of energy, briefly outshining entire galaxies.

The importance of Type Ia supernovae stems from their consistent peak brightness, which allows astronomers to utilize them as reliable standard candles for distance measurement. By comparing the observed luminosity of a Type Ia supernova to its intrinsic brightness, astronomers can accurately determine the distance to the supernova and assess the universe's expansion rate.

In 1998, observations of Type Ia supernovae revealed the accelerating expansion of the universe, a phenomenon attributed to dark energy. This groundbreaking discovery transformed our understanding of the cosmos and was recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011.

In summary, Type Ia supernovae are essential to cosmology, providing a consistent method for distance measurement and enhancing our comprehension of the universe's expansion and evolution.
