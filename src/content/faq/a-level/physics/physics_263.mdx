Wave frequency refers to the number of complete wave cycles that pass a given point in one second.

In physics, frequency is quantitatively defined as the number of cycles of a periodic wave that occur within a unit of time. For instance, if a wave completes one full cycle in one second, its frequency is expressed as one cycle per second, or $1 \, \text{Hz}$ (Hertz). The unit of frequency, Hertz, is part of the International System of Units (SI).

The frequency of a wave is primarily determined by its source and the medium through which it propagates. Generally, waves with higher frequencies correspond to shorter wavelengths and carry greater amounts of energy. Within the electromagnetic spectrum, the frequency of a wave dictates its position. Starting from the lowest frequency, we have radio waves, followed by microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and finally gamma rays, which possess the highest frequencies.

Wave frequency is a crucial concept across numerous fields of physics, including optics, acoustics, and electromagnetism. It serves to characterize the behavior of waves as they travel through various media, such as air, water, and solids. A thorough understanding of wave frequency is essential for grasping the properties of waves and their applications in diverse domains, including communication, medicine, and engineering.
