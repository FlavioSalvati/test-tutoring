Wave energy refers to the energy that can be harnessed from the movement of ocean waves.

As a form of renewable energy, wave energy captures the power generated by ocean waves to produce electricity. The mechanical force created as waves travel across the ocean surface can be converted into electrical energy using various devices, such as buoys, oscillating water columns, and submerged turbines.

The amount of energy that can be extracted from ocean waves is influenced by several factors, including wave height, wave period, and water density. Generally, waves with greater heights and longer periods contain more energy, making them more suitable for conversion into usable electricity.

Wave energy presents a promising opportunity for providing a substantial source of clean, renewable electricity. However, numerous technical and economic challenges must be addressed before it can become a commercially viable energy source. These challenges include the need for the development of efficient and cost-effective wave energy conversion technologies, as well as the construction of reliable and durable devices capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of the ocean environment.

Despite these challenges, the potential advantages of wave energy are considerable. It is a clean and renewable source of electricity that can help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and contribute to the mitigation of climate change impacts.
