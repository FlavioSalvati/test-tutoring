Radiation is measured using a device known as a Geiger-Müller tube, which is specifically designed to detect ionizing radiation.

To quantify the amount of radiation present, a Geiger-Müller tube is connected to a counting device, such as a scaler or a ratemeter. Inside the tube, a gas becomes ionized when radiation passes through it, generating a small electrical pulse. The counting device then measures the number of these pulses per second, which is directly proportional to the intensity of the radiation detected.

The standard unit of measurement for radiation is the becquerel (Bq), which is defined as one radioactive decay per second. Another commonly used unit is the sievert (Sv), which accounts for the biological effects of various types of radiation on human health.

It is important to recognize that different types of radiation possess varying levels of ionizing power, which affects their potential to cause damage to living tissue. For instance, alpha particles exhibit a high ionizing power but have a limited range, whereas gamma rays have a lower ionizing power yet can travel much further.

In summary, measuring radiation is essential for ensuring the safety of workers in nuclear industries and for monitoring radiation levels in the environment.
