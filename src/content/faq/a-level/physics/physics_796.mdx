The principle of wave polarization states that waves oscillate within a single plane that is perpendicular to their direction of propagation.

Polarization specifically refers to the orientation of the electric field vector associated with an electromagnetic wave. When a wave is polarized, its electric field vector oscillates exclusively in one plane that is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Consequently, the wave can only vibrate in this defined direction, and any components of the wave that are oriented perpendicular to this plane are effectively blocked.

There are three primary types of polarization: linear, circular, and elliptical. Linear polarization occurs when the electric field vector oscillates within a single plane. In contrast, circular polarization arises when the electric field vector rotates in a plane that is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Elliptical polarization can be viewed as a combination of both linear and circular polarization.

Polarization has numerous practical applications. For instance, in the production of 3D movies, polarized glasses are employed to separate the images intended for the left and right eyes. Additionally, polarization plays a crucial role in telecommunications, where it is utilized to transmit and receive signals with minimal interference. Furthermore, in the study of crystal structures, polarized light is instrumental in determining the orientation of molecules within a crystal.
