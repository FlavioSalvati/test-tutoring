The weak interaction is a fundamental force that plays a crucial role in the decay processes of subatomic particles.

As one of the four fundamental forces of nature—alongside gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong interaction—the weak interaction is primarily responsible for phenomena such as beta decay. In beta decay, a neutron transforms into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. This interaction is mediated by the exchange of W and Z bosons, which are massive particles that exist only for a fleeting moment.

Despite its significance, the weak interaction is considered "weak" in comparison to the other fundamental forces. It operates over a very short range, approximately $10^{-18}$ meters. Nonetheless, it facilitates some of the most critical processes in the universe, such as the fusion of hydrogen into helium within stars, which generates the energy that powers the Sun and other stars.

Additionally, the weak interaction is responsible for the phenomenon of parity violation, first observed in the decay of cobalt-60 nuclei. This discovery was pivotal in uncovering the nature of the weak interaction and led to the formulation of the electroweak theory, which unifies the weak interaction with the electromagnetic force. The electroweak theory is a cornerstone of the Standard Model of particle physics, which comprehensively describes the behavior of subatomic particles and the fundamental forces that govern their interactions.
