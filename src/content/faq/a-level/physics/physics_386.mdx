A neutron star is formed from the remnants of a supernova explosion, which occurs when a massive star reaches the end of its life cycle.

When a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it experiences a catastrophic gravitational collapse, leading to a supernova explosion. During this event, the core of the star collapses under its own gravity. If the mass of the core exceeds $1.4$ times that of the Sun—referred to as the Chandrasekhar limit—it will continue to collapse until protons and electrons combine to form neutrons. This process is known as electron capture.

The resulting neutron star is extraordinarily dense, possessing a mass approximately $1.4$ times that of the Sun, yet it has a radius of only about $10$ kilometers. The density of a neutron star is so immense that a mere teaspoon of its material would weigh around a billion tonnes.

In addition to their extreme density, neutron stars exhibit incredibly strong magnetic fields, which can be up to a billion times stronger than Earth's magnetic field. Moreover, many neutron stars rotate rapidly, with some spinning hundreds of times per second.

In summary, the formation of a neutron star involves the catastrophic collapse of a massive star during a supernova explosion, leading to the combination of protons and electrons into neutrons. The resultant neutron star is characterized by its extreme density, powerful magnetic field, and rapid rotation.
