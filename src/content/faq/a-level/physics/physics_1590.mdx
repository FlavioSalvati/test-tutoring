The resistance of a material typically increases as its temperature rises.

When a material is heated, the atoms within it begin to vibrate more vigorously. This increased atomic motion leads to a higher frequency of collisions between electrons and atoms. Consequently, electrons encounter greater resistance as they attempt to move through the material. This phenomenon is referred to as the temperature coefficient of resistance.

The temperature coefficient of resistance quantifies the extent to which a material's resistance changes in response to a change in temperature. Different materials exhibit varying temperature coefficients. Some materials have a positive temperature coefficient, meaning their resistance increases with temperature, while others have a negative temperature coefficient, indicating that their resistance decreases as temperature rises.

Understanding the temperature coefficient of resistance is crucial for the design of electrical circuits. Variations in temperature can significantly impact circuit performance. For instance, if a circuit is constructed using a material with a positive temperature coefficient, its efficiency may diminish with rising temperatures, potentially leading to overheating and damage to the circuit.

In summary, temperature plays a vital role in influencing the resistance of a material. An increase in temperature generally results in an increase in resistance due to heightened collisions between electrons and atoms. This relationship is quantitatively expressed by the temperature coefficient of resistance.
