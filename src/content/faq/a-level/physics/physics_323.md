To calculate the average kinetic energy of gas molecules, we use the formula:

$$ KE = \frac{3}{2} k T $$

Here, $KE$ represents the average kinetic energy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature measured in Kelvin.

The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. This implies that as the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules also increases. The relationship is captured in the formula:

$$ KE = \frac{3}{2} k T $$

The Boltzmann constant, $k$, is a fundamental physical constant that connects the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas to the temperature of that gas. Its approximate value is:

$$ k \approx 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} $$

It is crucial to note that the temperature $T$ must be expressed in Kelvin, the absolute temperature scale, where $0 \, \text{K}$ is defined as absolute zero, the lowest achievable temperature.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that this formula is based on the assumption that the gas behaves as an ideal gas. An ideal gas is characterized by the assumption that its molecules are point masses that interact only through perfectly elastic collisions, with no attractions or repulsions. In practice, however, most gases do not behave ideally, and the interactions between gas molecules can influence their kinetic energy.
