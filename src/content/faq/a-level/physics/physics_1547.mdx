In nuclear reactions, the equivalence of energy and mass is encapsulated in Einstein's renowned equation, $E = mc^2$.

During a nuclear reaction, the total mass of the reactants is not conserved; rather, a portion of the mass is transformed into energy. This energy manifests in various forms, including gamma rays, the kinetic energy of particles, and other energy types. The underlying reason for this transformation is the release of binding energy from the nucleus during the reaction, which corresponds to the mass that is lost.

Einstein's equation illustrates the relationship between energy and mass, stating that the energy ($E$) of a particle is equal to its mass ($m$) multiplied by the square of the speed of light ($c$). This implies that even a small amount of mass can be converted into a significant amount of energy, and conversely.

The conversion of mass into energy underpins the functioning of nuclear power and the destructive force of nuclear weapons. In nuclear power plants, the energy released from nuclear reactions is harnessed to generate electricity. In contrast, nuclear weapons utilize the energy released in these reactions to produce a devastating explosion.

In summary, the relationship between energy and mass in nuclear reactions is a fundamental principle in physics, with profound implications and practical applications in various fields.
