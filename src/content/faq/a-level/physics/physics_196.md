Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in objects when they are either stretched or compressed. This phenomenon is commonly observed in materials such as springs, rubber bands, and bungee cords. The amount of elastic potential energy stored in an object is directly related to the degree of deformation, which refers to how much the object has been stretched or compressed. The formula for calculating elastic potential energy is 

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2,
$$ 

where $k$ represents the spring constant and $x$ denotes the amount of deformation. For a deeper understanding of energy dynamics in systems like springs, consider exploring the principles of energy in simple harmonic motion.

On the other hand, gravitational potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position within a gravitational field. This type of energy is influenced by the object's mass, its height relative to a designated reference point, and the strength of the gravitational field. The formula for gravitational potential energy is 

$$
E = mgh,
$$ 

where $m$ is the mass of the object, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height above the reference point. For a more focused discussion on gravitational potential energy, additional resources may be beneficial.

Both elastic potential energy and gravitational potential energy are classifications of potential energy, indicating that they have the capacity to perform work. When an object is released from a state of potential energy, this energy can be converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy associated with motion. To further explore the various forms of energy and their transformations, you may find additional resources helpful. Understanding these distinct types of potential energy is crucial in many areas of physics, particularly in mechanics and thermodynamics.

**A-Level Physics Tutor Summary**: Elastic potential energy is stored when objects, like springs, are stretched or compressed, calculated using the formula 

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2.
$$ 

Gravitational potential energy is related to an object's height in a gravitational field and is determined by the formula 

$$
E = mgh, 
$$ 

which involves its mass and height. Both types of potential energy can be transformed into kinetic energy, making them essential for grasping fundamental physics principles.
