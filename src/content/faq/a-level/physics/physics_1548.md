Capacitance is typically measured using a capacitance meter or an oscilloscope in conjunction with a known frequency.

Capacitance refers to the ability of a capacitor to store electrical charge and is quantified in farads (F). Several factors influence capacitance:

1. **Distance Between Plates**: The capacitance increases as the distance between the capacitor plates decreases. 
2. **Plate Area**: A larger plate area results in higher capacitance.
3. **Dielectric Constant**: The material between the plates affects capacitance; a higher dielectric constant leads to greater capacitance.

Additionally, capacitance can be influenced by the presence of nearby conductive materials, a phenomenon known as stray capacitance. This can introduce errors in measurements. To mitigate stray capacitance, capacitors are often shielded or placed within a grounded metal enclosure.

Capacitance plays a critical role in various applications, including filters, timing circuits, and power supplies. Accurate measurement of capacitance is essential to ensure the proper operation of these electronic circuits.
