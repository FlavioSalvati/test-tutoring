The strength of the gravitational field diminishes with increasing distance from its source.

As an object moves farther away from a source of gravity, the gravitational field strength decreases. This phenomenon occurs because the force of gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects. Specifically, when the distance between two objects is doubled, the gravitational force reduces to one-fourth of its original value.

The mathematical expression for gravitational field strength is given by the equation:

$$
g = \frac{Gm}{r^2}
$$

In this equation, $g$ represents the gravitational field strength, $G$ denotes the gravitational constant, $m$ is the mass of the object generating the gravitational field, and $r$ is the distance from the object. From this formula, it is evident that as $r$ increases, the value of $g$ decreases.

Understanding the relationship between gravitational field strength and distance is crucial in various fields of physics, including astronomy and space exploration. For instance, spacecraft must consider the gravitational field strength of planets and other celestial bodies when plotting their trajectories. Similarly, astronomers utilize gravitational field strength to investigate the characteristics of stars and galaxies.

In summary, the gravitational field strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of gravity, as articulated by the equation $g = \frac{Gm}{r^2}$. This relationship plays a significant role in multiple domains of physics.
