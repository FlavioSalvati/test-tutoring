The dielectric constant is a crucial parameter that quantifies a material's ability to store electrical energy within an electric field. It plays a significant role in influencing the capacitance of capacitors by enhancing it.

The dielectric constant, often referred to as relative permittivity, is defined as the ratio of the electric flux density generated in a material to the electric flux density produced in a vacuum under the same electric field strength. By convention, the dielectric constant of a vacuum is set to $1$, while the dielectric constants of other materials are always greater than $1$.

When a dielectric material is introduced between the plates of a capacitor, the capacitance of that capacitor increases. This occurs because the dielectric material diminishes the electric field strength between the plates, which in turn reduces the potential difference across them. As a result, the amount of charge that can be stored on the plates increases without a corresponding rise in potential difference, leading to a higher capacitance.

The extent to which capacitance increases is directly related to the dielectric constant of the material used. A higher dielectric constant indicates that the material has a greater capacity to store electrical energy per unit volume, resulting in a more significant reduction in the electric field between the capacitor plates.

In summary, the dielectric constant serves as a measure of a material's ability to store electrical energy, and it has a direct impact on capacitance by increasing it. The greater the dielectric constant, the more substantial the increase in capacitance observed.
