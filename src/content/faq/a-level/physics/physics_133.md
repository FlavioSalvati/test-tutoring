Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans are a powerful diagnostic tool that utilizes magnetic fields and radio waves to generate highly detailed images of the body's internal structures.

The process begins with a strong magnetic field that aligns the protons found in the tissues of the body. Following this alignment, radio waves are introduced, causing these protons to emit signals. These signals are then captured by the MRI machine and processed by a computer, resulting in intricate images that can reveal the presence of tumors.

One of the key advantages of MRI scans is their ability to differentiate between tumors and surrounding tissues, as tumors typically possess distinct magnetic properties. This capability makes MRI particularly effective for identifying tumors in soft tissues, such as the brain, spinal cord, and muscles. Furthermore, MRI scans can also be employed to detect tumors in other organs, including the liver, kidneys, and lungs.

Beyond mere detection, MRI scans provide critical information regarding the size and location of tumors, as well as whether they have metastasized to other areas of the body. This detailed imaging is essential for formulating an effective treatment plan tailored to each patient's specific condition.
