To determine the power output of an engine, it is essential to measure both the torque and the rotational speed.

The power output quantifies the amount of work an engine can perform over a specific period. It is calculated by multiplying the torque, which is the force applied to turn the engine, by the rotational speed, representing how quickly the engine is rotating. The relationship can be expressed using the formula:

$$
P = T \cdot \omega
$$

Here, $P$ denotes power, $T$ represents torque, and $\omega$ signifies rotational speed.

Torque can be measured using a dynamometer, a device that applies a load to the engine and records the force necessary to rotate it. The rotational speed is typically measured with a tachometer, which provides the number of revolutions per minute (RPM) of the engine.

After obtaining the measurements for both torque and rotational speed, you can utilize the aforementioned formula to calculate the engine's power output. It is important to keep in mind that the power output may fluctuate due to various factors, including temperature, fuel quality, and engine wear.

In summary, to compute the power output of an engine, measure the torque and rotational speed using a dynamometer and a tachometer, respectively, and then apply the formula:

$$
P = T \cdot \omega
$$
