Nuclear fusion is the fundamental process that powers stars by converting hydrogen into helium through a series of fusion reactions.

In essence, nuclear fusion involves the merging of atomic nuclei to create heavier elements. Within stars, this process initiates with the fusion of hydrogen atoms, resulting in the formation of helium. Such reactions release a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat, which is the energy source that fuels the sun and other stars.

The conditions necessary for nuclear fusion occur at extraordinarily high temperatures and pressures. For instance, in the core of the sun, temperatures exceed $15$ million degrees Celsius, and the pressures are more than $250$ billion times that of Earth's atmosphere. Under these extreme conditions, hydrogen atoms can overcome their inherent repulsion and combine to form helium.

During the fusion process, energy is emitted in the form of photons. These photons are absorbed and re-emitted by the surrounding matter, gradually making their way to the surface of the star. Ultimately, this energy is radiated into space as light and heat.

Nuclear fusion is remarkably efficient, as nearly all of the mass of the hydrogen atoms is converted into energy. This high efficiency makes nuclear fusion an appealing potential source of energy for human use. However, replicating the extreme conditions required for nuclear fusion on Earth poses a considerable technical challenge.
