A diode is a semiconductor device that permits current to flow exclusively in one direction. It consists of two terminals: the anode and the cathode. When a voltage applied to the anode exceeds the voltage at the cathode, the diode enters a forward-biased state, allowing current to flow. Conversely, if the voltage at the cathode surpasses that at the anode, the diode becomes reverse-biased, preventing current from flowing.

In power supply applications, diodes are commonly utilized as rectifiers to convert alternating current (AC) voltage into direct current (DC) voltage. AC voltage is applied to the input of the power supply, and the diode only allows the positive half of the AC waveform to pass through, while effectively blocking the negative half. This process results in a pulsating DC voltage at the output of the power supply.

To further refine the pulsating DC voltage, capacitors are typically employed alongside diodes. During the positive half of the waveform, the capacitor charges, and during the negative half, it discharges. This action provides a more stable DC voltage at the output.

In summary, the diode plays an essential role in the conversion of AC voltage to DC voltage within a power supply. It ensures that current flows in only one direction and facilitates the use of additional components, such as capacitors, to smooth the output voltage effectively.
