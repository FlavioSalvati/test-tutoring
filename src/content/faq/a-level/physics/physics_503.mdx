The W and Z bosons are fundamental particles that mediate the weak force, which is responsible for processes such as radioactive decay and neutrino interactions.

The weak force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, alongside gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong force. It plays a crucial role in phenomena like radioactive decay and the interactions of neutrinos. The W and Z bosons serve as the force carriers of the weak force, facilitating interactions between various particles.

The W boson exists in two charged varieties: $W^+$ and $W^-$. These bosons have opposite electric charges and are integral to particle decay processes, such as beta decay. In beta decay, a neutron decays into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. During this process, the W boson mediates the interaction between the neutron and the proton, enabling the decay to occur.

The Z boson, on the other hand, is electrically neutral and is primarily responsible for mediating interactions involving neutrinos. Neutrinos are elusive particles that interact very weakly with matter, making them challenging to detect. The Z boson facilitates the weak interactions between neutrinos and other particles, thereby allowing for their detection.

In summary, the W and Z bosons are essential components of the weak force, mediating interactions between particles and enabling key processes such as radioactive decay and neutrino interactions.
