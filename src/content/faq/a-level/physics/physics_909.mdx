Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is a specific type of periodic motion that is intrinsically linked to wave motion.

In SHM, the restoring force acting on an object is directly proportional to its displacement from a position of equilibrium. This behavior is commonly observed in systems such as a mass attached to a spring or a swinging pendulum. Mathematically, SHM can be represented using sine and cosine functions, which are also fundamental to the description of wave motion.

Wave motion refers to the transfer of energy through a medium without the accompanying transfer of matter. Waves are characterized by several key properties, including amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and speed. Similar to SHM, the motion of particles in a wave is periodic. However, a significant distinction between the two is that the motion of particles in a wave occurs perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, while in SHM, the motion occurs along a single axis.

The connection between SHM and wave motion is exemplified by a vibrating string. When a string is plucked, it experiences SHM, with the tension in the string providing the necessary restoring force. This oscillation generates a disturbance that propagates along the string as a wave. Like other waves, this wave can also be described by its amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and speed.

In summary, SHM and wave motion are interconnected through their periodic characteristics and the use of sine and cosine functions to model their behavior. While the motion of particles in a wave is perpendicular to the wave's direction, SHM involves motion along a single axis.
