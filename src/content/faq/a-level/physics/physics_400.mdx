Lasers generate coherent light through the process of stimulated emission of photons within a gain medium.

In the field of optoelectronics, lasers serve as a vital light source for various applications, including communication, sensing, and imaging. A typical laser consists of a gain medium, which can be either a solid-state crystal or a gas, and two mirrors positioned at either end of the gain medium. One of these mirrors is partially transparent, allowing a portion of the light to escape and form the laser output.

When energy is supplied to the gain medium, the atoms or molecules within it become excited and transition to a higher energy state. As they return to their ground state, they emit photons of light. In a laser, this emission process is stimulated by the presence of existing photons in the gain medium, resulting in a chain reaction of photon emission.

The mirrors at both ends of the gain medium reflect the photons back and forth, amplifying the light and ensuring it becomes coherent. Coherence implies that all the emitted photons are in phase with one another, producing a narrow beam of light characterized by a well-defined wavelength.

The wavelength of the laser output is determined by the specific properties of both the gain medium and the mirrors. By fine-tuning these characteristics, lasers can be engineered to emit light at designated wavelengths, making them highly versatile for a range of applications in optoelectronics.
