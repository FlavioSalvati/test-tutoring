Wave nodes are points in a standing wave where the amplitude is zero.

In a standing wave, there are specific locations known as nodes where the wave's amplitude reaches zero. These nodes occur because, at these positions, the wave is canceled out by an equal and opposite wave. Essentially, this results in the wave reflecting back upon itself, leading to a point of no amplitude.

Conversely, antinodes are points on a standing wave where the amplitude reaches its maximum value. At these locations, the wave is reinforced by a corresponding wave, which amplifies the overall effect. As a result, antinodes are characterized by maximum amplitude.

The distance between two adjacent nodes or between two adjacent antinodes is equal to half the wavelength of the wave. This relationship arises because, at these points, the wave is either being canceled out (at nodes) or reinforced (at antinodes). The specific positions of the nodes and antinodes are determined by the boundary conditions of the system, such as the length of the string or the shape of the container.

Understanding the concepts of wave nodes and antinodes is crucial for studying standing waves and resonance. This knowledge enables us to predict the behavior of waves in various systems and to design systems that leverage these wave properties effectively.
