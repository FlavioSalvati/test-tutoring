Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon where light is bent by the gravitational field of massive objects in space.

When light from a distant source approaches a massive object, such as a galaxy or a black hole, the object's gravitational force can alter the light's trajectory. As a result, this bending causes the light to be distorted, making it appear as though it is emanating from a different position. This effect is referred to as gravitational lensing.

There are two primary types of gravitational lensing: strong lensing and weak lensing. Strong gravitational lensing occurs when the light is bent sufficiently to produce multiple images of the same object. In contrast, weak gravitational lensing involves only slight bending of the light, leading to a distortion of the object's appearance without the formation of multiple images.

Astronomers utilize gravitational lensing to investigate the characteristics of massive celestial bodies, including galaxies and black holes. By analyzing how light is deflected around these massive objects, scientists can infer their mass and structural composition.

Moreover, gravitational lensing plays a crucial role in the detection and study of dark matter. Since dark matter does not emit light, it remains invisible to direct observation. However, its existence can be inferred by examining the way light is bent around it, as revealed through gravitational lensing.

In summary, gravitational lensing serves as a vital instrument for astronomers, enabling them to explore the properties of cosmic objects and deepen our understanding of the universe's many enigmas.
