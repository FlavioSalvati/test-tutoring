The principle of projectile motion asserts that an object in motion will trace a parabolic path.

When an object is launched into the air, it undergoes two distinct types of motion: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal motion remains constant and is unaffected by gravity, while the vertical motion is influenced by gravity and accelerates downward at a rate of $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$. The interplay of these two motions leads to the formation of a parabolic trajectory.
