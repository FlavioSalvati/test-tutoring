The magnifying power of a simple microscope is calculated by dividing the distance of the object from the lens by the lens's focal length.

A simple microscope, often referred to as a magnifying glass, consists of a single convex lens. The magnifying power of this lens is influenced by its focal length, which is the distance from the lens to the point where light rays converge to form a clear image. Generally, a shorter focal length results in greater magnifying power.

To calculate the magnifying power of a simple microscope, you divide the distance from the object to the lens by the focal length of the lens. For instance, if the object is positioned $10 \, \text{cm}$ from the lens and the focal length of the lens is $5 \, \text{cm}$, the magnifying power can be determined as follows:

$$
\text{Magnifying Power} = \frac{\text{Distance from Lens}}{\text{Focal Length}} = \frac{10 \, \text{cm}}{5 \, \text{cm}} = 2 \, \text{x}
$$

It is crucial to recognize that the magnifying power of a simple microscope has limitations. These limitations arise from both the size of the lens and the distance between the lens and the object being viewed. As the distance from the lens to the object increases, the image tends to become blurrier, leading to a decrease in magnifying power. Furthermore, the size of the lens restricts the amount of light that enters the microscope, which can further impact the clarity of the image.

In summary, the magnifying power of a simple microscope depends on the distance of the object from the lens and the lens's focal length. By understanding these limitations, users can make more accurate observations and measurements.
