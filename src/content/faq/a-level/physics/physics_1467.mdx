The direction of a magnetic field can be determined through the use of a compass or a current-carrying conductor.

To identify the direction of a magnetic field, a compass is a practical tool. The needle of the compass aligns itself with the magnetic field lines, effectively indicating the direction of the field. Specifically, the north pole of the compass needle points towards the south pole of a magnet, and conversely, the south pole of the needle points towards the magnet's north pole.

Alternatively, the direction of a magnetic field can be ascertained using a current-carrying conductor. In this case, the right-hand grip rule is employed. According to this rule, if you position your right hand so that your thumb points in the direction of the electric current, your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines. Consequently, the palm of your hand will face in the direction of the force experienced by a positive charge moving through the field. 

Moreover, the right-hand screw rule provides another method for determining the direction of a magnetic field. By imagining that you are turning a screw in the direction of the electric current with your right hand, the direction in which the screw advances indicates the direction of the magnetic field.

In conclusion, the direction of a magnetic field can be determined using three primary methods: a compass, the right-hand grip rule with a current-carrying conductor, or the right-hand screw rule.
