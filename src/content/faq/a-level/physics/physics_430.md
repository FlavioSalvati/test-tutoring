To determine the power delivered by a battery in a circuit, you can use the formula that multiplies the voltage by the current.

The power provided by a battery is a function of both the voltage and the current in the circuit. Here, the voltage represents the potential difference between the two terminals of the battery, while the current signifies the flow of electric charge through the circuit. The unit of power is measured in watts, which is defined as the product of volts and amperes.

To calculate the power delivered by a battery, simply multiply the voltage ($V$) by the current ($I$). This relationship can be expressed as:

$$
P = V \times I
$$

For instance, if a battery has a voltage of $12$ volts and the current flowing through the circuit is $1$ ampere, the power delivered by the battery can be calculated as follows:

$$
P = 12 \, \text{volts} \times 1 \, \text{ampere} = 12 \, \text{watts}
$$

It is essential to understand that the power delivered by a battery is not a fixed value; it varies depending on the load connected to the circuit. The load refers to the components within the circuit that consume power, such as light bulbs or motors. As the load increases, the current in the circuit typically increases as well, which consequently raises the power delivered by the battery.
