The induced electromotive force (EMF) is directly proportional to the rate at which magnetic flux changes.

When magnetic flux varies, an EMF is generated in a conductor, a phenomenon known as electromagnetic induction. The magnitude of the induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux. This principle is encapsulated in Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.

According to Faraday's law, the induced EMF is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
E = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt}
$$

where $E$ represents the induced EMF, $\Phi$ denotes the magnetic flux, and $t$ stands for time. The negative sign in this equation indicates that the induced EMF acts in opposition to the change in magnetic flux that caused it.

Magnetic flux itself is defined as the product of the magnetic field strength and the area that is perpendicular to the field. Consequently, the rate of change of magnetic flux can be increased by altering the magnetic field strength, modifying the area, or changing the angle between the magnetic field and the area. Practical methods to achieve this include moving a magnet toward or away from a conductor, rotating a coil within a magnetic field, or varying the current in a nearby conductor.

In summary, the induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux, as expressed by Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. This fundamental relationship underpins numerous applications of electromagnetic induction, including generators, transformers, and electric motors.
