Conservation laws are foundational principles in physics that assert certain quantities remain constant within a closed system. In the realm of particle physics, these laws include the conservation of energy, momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge.

The conservation of energy is a particularly vital principle. It acknowledges that while particles can be created or annihilated, the total energy of a closed system must remain unchanged. Mathematically, if particles A and B interact to produce particles C and D, the total energy before and after the interaction must satisfy the equation:

$$ E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}} $$

Likewise, the conservation of momentum states that the total momentum in a system is preserved, regardless of any changes in the momentum of individual particles. This means that if particles collide or undergo any interaction, the total momentum before the interaction will equal the total momentum afterward:

$$ p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}} $$

Another essential conservation law in particle physics is the conservation of angular momentum. This principle is crucial when considering particles that possess spin or rotate. It asserts that the total angular momentum of a system remains constant, even as particles may change their spin states or orientations:

$$ L_{\text{initial}} = L_{\text{final}} $$

Lastly, the conservation of electric charge is a fundamental law that applies to particles with positive or negative charges. This law posits that the total electric charge in a closed system remains constant, regardless of the creation or annihilation of charged particles:

$$ Q_{\text{initial}} = Q_{\text{final}} $$

In summary, conservation laws are indispensable in particle physics, offering a structured framework for comprehending particle behavior and their interactions. By studying these laws, physicists can formulate predictions regarding particle dynamics and rigorously test their theoretical models through experimental observations.
