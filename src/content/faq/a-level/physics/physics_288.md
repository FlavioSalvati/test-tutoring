The work done during a thermodynamic process can be calculated with the formula 

$$
W = P \Delta V
$$

where $W$ represents the work done, $P$ is the pressure, and $\Delta V$ is the change in volume.

Thermodynamics is the field of study that explores the relationships between heat, work, and energy. In a thermodynamic process, work is performed when there is a change in either volume or pressure. To apply the formula, you must know the initial and final volumes and pressures of the system. 

If the pressure remains constant throughout the process, the formula simplifies to 

$$
W = P (V_f - V_i)
$$ 

where $V_f$ is the final volume and $V_i$ is the initial volume. Conversely, if the volume is constant, the work done is zero, as there is no change in volume.

It is crucial to recognize that work is a scalar quantity, which means it possesses magnitude but does not have a direction. The standard unit of work is joules (J). A positive value of work indicates that the system is performing work on the surroundings, while a negative value signifies that work is being done on the system by the surroundings.

In summary, the formula 

$$
W = P \Delta V
$$ 

is an essential tool for calculating the work done in a thermodynamic process. Understanding the initial and final states of the system, along with the changes in pressure and volume, is key to effectively utilizing this formula.
