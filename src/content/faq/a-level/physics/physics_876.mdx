The curvature of spacetime around a massive object indicates that the object distorts the very fabric of space and time.

When a massive object is present, it induces a curvature in spacetime. This curvature arises from the object's mass and is directly proportional to its size. Consequently, the greater the mass of the object, the more pronounced the curvature it produces. This curvature influences the motion of nearby objects, compelling them to follow a curved trajectory rather than a straight line.

The curvature of spacetime is fundamentally responsible for the phenomenon we recognize as gravity. Objects with mass attract one another because they move along the paths dictated by the curvature of spacetime generated by each other's mass. Thus, the more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull becomes.

Furthermore, the curvature of spacetime has a significant impact on the passage of time. In regions characterized by strong gravitational fields—such as those near massive objects—time flows more slowly. This effect, known as time dilation, has been confirmed through various experiments involving atomic clocks.

In summary, the curvature of spacetime around a massive object signifies that this object warps the fabric of space and time. This distortion not only influences the motion of nearby objects, leading to the phenomenon of gravity, but also alters the passage of time, resulting in time dilation in areas with intense gravitational fields.
