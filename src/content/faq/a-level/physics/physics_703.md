To determine the power needed to move an object against friction, we must take several factors into account.

First, we need to calculate the force required to overcome the friction acting on the object. This can be accomplished using the equation:

$$
F = \mu N
$$

In this equation, $F$ represents the frictional force, $\mu$ denotes the coefficient of friction, and $N$ is the normal force acting on the object.

Once we have established the required force, we can calculate the work done by multiplying this force by the distance traveled. This calculation yields the energy necessary to move the object against friction.

Finally, we can determine the power required by dividing the work done (energy) by the time taken to move the object. This calculation provides us with the rate at which energy is expended, or the power necessary to counteract the frictional force:

$$
P = \frac{W}{t}
$$

where $P$ is the power, $W$ is the work done, and $t$ is the time taken.

It is essential to recognize that the coefficient of friction can vary based on the surfaces in contact and the conditions present. Therefore, accurate measurements and calculations are crucial for obtaining precise results. Additionally, the power required may fluctuate with the speed at which the object is moved, as air resistance can become a significant factor at higher velocities.
