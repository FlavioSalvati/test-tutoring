At resonance, a series resonant circuit exhibits maximum current flow and minimum impedance.

When a series resonant circuit reaches resonance, the inductive reactance and capacitive reactance effectively cancel each other out. This cancellation results in a purely resistive circuit, which leads to the impedance being at its minimum value. Consequently, this condition allows the maximum current to pass through the circuit.

At the point of resonance, the voltages across the capacitor and inductor are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in a net voltage of zero across the circuit. This condition implies that the power factor of the circuit is unity, indicating that the circuit is in a state of resonance.

The frequency at which resonance occurs is determined by the values of the inductor and capacitor in the circuit. This frequency, known as the resonant frequency, can be calculated using the formula:

$$
f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}},
$$

where $L$ represents the inductance of the inductor, $C$ denotes the capacitance of the capacitor, and $\pi$ is the mathematical constant pi.

In practical applications, series resonant circuits are commonly employed in radio and television tuning circuits, as well as in power factor correction circuits. Understanding the behavior of a series resonant circuit at resonance is crucial for the design and optimization of these types of circuits.
