Impedance is defined as the total opposition that a circuit presents to the flow of alternating current (AC).

In an AC circuit, the current does not flow steadily; instead, it oscillates back and forth. Impedance quantifies the overall opposition that the circuit offers to this alternating current. It is a complex quantity that encompasses both resistance and reactance. Resistance refers to the opposition to current flow stemming from the material properties of the circuit, while reactance arises from the circuit's capacitance and inductance.

Impedance is measured in ohms and is denoted by the symbol $Z$. It can be expressed using the formula:

$$
Z = R + jX
$$

where $R$ represents the resistance, $X$ denotes the reactance, and $j$ is the imaginary unit. The magnitude of impedance is calculated as:

$$
|Z| = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2}
$$

and its phase angle is determined using the formula:

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{X}{R}\right).
$$

Impedance is a critical factor in AC circuit analysis, as it influences the amount of current that flows through the circuit. In a series circuit, the total impedance is the sum of the individual impedances. Conversely, in a parallel circuit, the total impedance can be calculated using the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual impedances.

A solid understanding of impedance is essential for the design and analysis of AC circuits, particularly in applications related to power transmission and distribution.
