Fiber optic cables transmit data using light signals, providing a highly efficient method for communication.

These cables consist of thin strands of glass or plastic known as optical fibers. Each fiber is coated with a cladding material that reflects light back into the core, enabling the light to travel through the fiber without escaping. Surrounding the core and cladding is a protective layer called a buffer, which safeguards the fibers against damage.

Data transmission through a fiber optic cable begins with a device known as a transmitter, which converts the data into light signals. These light signals are then transmitted through the fiber optic cable, where they bounce off the cladding and travel down the core. One of the primary advantages of fiber optic technology is that these light signals can travel long distances with minimal loss of strength, making fiber optic cables ideal for long-range communication.

At the receiving end of the fiber optic cable, the light signals are detected by a device called a receiver. The receiver's role is to convert the light signals back into data, which can then be processed by computers or other devices.

Fiber optic cables provide numerous advantages over traditional copper cables, including:

- **Faster data transmission speeds**
- **Greater bandwidth**
- **Immunity to electromagnetic interference**

Due to these benefits, fiber optic cables are widely used in various applications, including telecommunications, internet infrastructure, and medical equipment.
