Beta minus decay is a specific type of radioactive decay characterized by the transformation of a neutron within an atomic nucleus into a proton, accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino.

In the process of beta minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus converts into a proton while releasing an electron (often referred to as a beta particle) and an antineutrino. The emitted electron carries away some of the energy produced during this transformation, while the antineutrino, a neutral particle that is challenging to detect, is essential for maintaining the conservation of energy and momentum throughout the decay process.

Beta minus decay typically occurs in atomic nuclei with an excess of neutrons relative to protons. This decay mechanism serves to stabilize the nucleus by adjusting the neutron-to-proton ratio. The decay constant, which determines the rate of beta minus decay, varies for different isotopes and can range widely from fractions of a second to billions of years.

This decay process has numerous applications, particularly in nuclear power and medical imaging. In the context of nuclear power generation, beta minus decay contributes to electricity production by generating heat to convert water into steam, which subsequently drives turbines. In medical imaging, beta minus decay is utilized in positron emission tomography (PET) scans, a technique that creates detailed images of internal organs and tissues in the human body.

In summary, beta minus decay is a crucial phenomenon in nuclear physics, impacting both fundamental research and various practical applications.
