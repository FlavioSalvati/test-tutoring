Optical instruments utilize the principle of interference to measure small distances with exceptional precision.

Interferometers are a key type of optical instrument that employ this principle. Interference occurs when two or more waves overlap and combine. In an interferometer, a beam of light is split into two distinct paths, which are later recombined. By analyzing the resulting interference pattern, one can determine the difference in distance between these two paths.

A prominent example of an interferometer is the Michelson interferometer. This device comprises a beam splitter, two mirrors, and a detector. The beam splitter divides the incoming light beam into two paths, which reflect off the mirrors and are subsequently combined at the detector. The interference pattern observed at the detector is analyzed to ascertain the difference in distance between the two paths.

Another notable type of interferometer is the Fabry-Perot interferometer. This instrument features two parallel mirrors with a gap between them. Light enters this gap and is reflected back and forth between the mirrors. The resulting interference pattern is examined to determine the distance between the mirrors.

Optical instruments based on the principle of interference find a wide range of applications. They are used for measuring the thickness of thin films, detecting minute vibrations, and precisely measuring the distance between two objects. The interference principle enables highly accurate measurements, achieving resolutions on the order of nanometers.
