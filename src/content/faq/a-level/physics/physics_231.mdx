The strength of the gravitational field decreases as the height above the Earth's surface increases.

When an object ascends away from the Earth's surface, the distance between that object and the center of the Earth increases. This increase in distance leads to a reduction in the gravitational force exerted on the object, which follows the inverse square law of gravitation. Consequently, the gravitational field strength diminishes with rising altitude. For a more comprehensive understanding of gravitational forces, you may find a certain page helpful; although it primarily addresses magnetic fields, it also discusses fundamental concepts that are relevant to various fields of physics.

The gravitational field strength at a height $h$ above the Earth's surface can be determined using the formula:

$$
g = \frac{GM}{(R+h)^2}
$$

Here, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the Earth, and $R$ is the Earth's radius. As the height $h$ increases, the term $(R+h)^2$ in the denominator becomes larger, leading to a decrease in gravitational field strength. For a more detailed explanation of this equation, please visit the referenced page.

At the Earth's surface, the gravitational field strength is approximately $9.81 \, \text{N/kg}$. As an object moves away from the surface, this strength diminishes. For instance, at a height of $100 \, \text{km}$ above the Earth's surface, the gravitational field strength is roughly $8.7 \, \text{N/kg}$. At an altitude of $1000 \, \text{km}$, the gravitational field strength further decreases to around $6.6 \, \text{N/kg}$.

In summary, the gravitational field strength decreases with increasing height above the Earth's surface due to the inverse square law of gravitational attraction. This phenomenon has significant implications for satellite orbits and space travel. Furthermore, the concept of gravitational interactions helps explain these observations across various distances from the Earth. For additional insights into the effects of gravitational variations at different altitudes, the aforementioned page offers valuable information.
