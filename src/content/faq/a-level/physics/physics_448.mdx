Power in an alternating current (AC) circuit can be expressed as the product of current and voltage, represented by the formula:

$$ P = VI $$

In an AC circuit, both the voltage and current fluctuate sinusoidally over time. Here, voltage refers to the potential difference across the circuit, while current indicates the flow of electric charge through it. The relationship between voltage and current is governed by Ohm's Law, which states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it, assuming that temperature and other physical conditions remain constant.

Since the voltage and current in an AC circuit vary sinusoidally, the power also changes over time. The average power over one complete cycle of the AC waveform is calculated using the root mean square (RMS) values of voltage and current. This relationship is given by the formula:

$$ P = V_{\text{rms}} I_{\text{rms}} $$

where $V_{\text{rms}}$ and $I_{\text{rms}}$ represent the root mean square values of voltage and current, respectively.

In the context of AC circuits, the power factor is an important metric that quantifies the efficiency of power usage. It is defined as the ratio of real power to apparent power. Real power is the average power consumed over one cycle of the waveform, while apparent power is the product of the RMS values of voltage and current. A high power factor indicates that the circuit is using power efficiently, whereas a low power factor suggests that power is being wasted.

For more detailed information on how power varies with current and voltage in AC circuits, please refer to the relevant resources. Additionally, for a deeper understanding of the implications of varying potential in electrical systems, further exploration of specialized topics is encouraged. Understanding the power factor, which reflects how effectively power is utilized in a circuit, can provide valuable insights into AC circuit performance.
