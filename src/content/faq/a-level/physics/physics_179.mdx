Isothermal and adiabatic processes are two fundamental types of thermodynamic processes that illustrate how a system responds to changes in temperature and pressure.

An **isothermal process** is defined as a thermodynamic process that occurs at a constant temperature. During an isothermal process, the system maintains thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, which means there is no net heat transfer between the system and its environment. This type of process is commonly utilized in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, as well as in the production of liquefied gases.

In contrast, an **adiabatic process** is characterized by the absence of heat transfer between the system and its surroundings. In an adiabatic process, the system is effectively insulated, preventing any heat from entering or leaving the system. This type of process is frequently employed in the compression and expansion of gases, such as in the operation of internal combustion engines.

Both isothermal and adiabatic processes play a crucial role in thermodynamics, as they provide insights into how energy is transferred and transformed within a system. A thorough understanding of these processes is vital for numerous applications in engineering and physics, ranging from the design of refrigeration systems to the efficient operation of power plants.
