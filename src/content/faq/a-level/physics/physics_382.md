Nuclear decay refers to the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus releases radiation in order to achieve a more stable configuration.

During nuclear decay, an unstable atomic nucleus transforms into a more stable state. This transformation can occur via three primary types of decay: alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay. 

1. **Alpha Decay**: In this process, the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is composed of two protons and two neutrons. As a result, the atomic number decreases by $2$ and the mass number reduces by $4$.

2. **Beta Decay**: Here, the nucleus emits a beta particle, which can be either an electron or a positron. This emission changes the atomic number by $1$, while the mass number remains unchanged.

3. **Gamma Decay**: In gamma decay, the nucleus releases a gamma ray, which is a high-energy photon. This process does not alter either the atomic number or the mass number.

The rate at which nuclear decay occurs is quantified by the half-life. The half-life is defined as the time required for half of the radioactive material to decay. This duration is a unique characteristic of each radioactive isotope and can vary widely, ranging from mere fractions of a second to billions of years.

Nuclear decay is significant in various fields, including nuclear physics, medicine, and energy production. It is utilized in medical imaging techniques and cancer treatments, as well as in nuclear power plants for electricity generation. However, nuclear decay also poses potential risks to human health and the environment if not managed appropriately. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of nuclear decay and its broader implications.
