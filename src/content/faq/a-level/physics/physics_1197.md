Snell's Law of refraction describes the relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction when light transitions between two different media. Specifically, it states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction remains constant.

When light travels from one medium to another, its speed changes, causing it to bend. The degree of bending is influenced by both the angle at which the light strikes the boundary and the properties of the two media involved. Snell's Law provides a mathematical framework to relate these angles to the refractive indices of the respective media.

Mathematically, Snell's Law can be expressed as:

$$ n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2 $$

Here, $n_1$ and $n_2$ represent the refractive indices of the first and second media, respectively. The angle of incidence is denoted as $\theta_1$, while the angle of refraction is represented as $\theta_2$. The refractive index is a dimensionless quantity that indicates how much a material reduces the speed of light compared to a vacuum.

Snell's Law has a wide array of applications in optics, including the design of lenses, prisms, and optical fibers. It also explains everyday phenomena, such as the apparent bending of a straw when it is partially submerged in a glass of water.

Understanding Snell's Law is crucial in the field of physics, as it lays the groundwork for comprehending how light behaves in various media. This fundamental principle is widely utilized across numerous scientific and engineering disciplines.
