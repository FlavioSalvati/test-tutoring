Stellar nucleosynthesis refers to the process by which stars generate new elements through the mechanism of nuclear fusion.

In the initial phases of a star's life cycle, hydrogen atoms in its core fuse together to form helium. This fusion process releases an immense amount of energy, which counteracts the gravitational forces trying to collapse the star. As the star ages and depletes its hydrogen reserves, it transitions to fusing helium into heavier elements, such as carbon and oxygen.

For stars that have masses exceeding approximately eight times that of the Sun, the fusion process continues until the core becomes predominantly composed of iron. At this stage, fusion ceases to produce energy, leading to a catastrophic collapse of the core under its own gravitational pull. This collapse results in a supernova explosion, which releases vast quantities of energy and facilitates the formation of even heavier elements, such as gold and uranium.

The elements synthesized during stellar nucleosynthesis are expelled into space when the star ultimately reaches the end of its life. These elements serve as the fundamental building blocks for the formation of new stars and planets. Without the process of stellar nucleosynthesis, the universe would primarily consist of hydrogen and helium, rendering the existence of life as we know it impossible.
