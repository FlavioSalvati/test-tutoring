A photon detector functions by converting incoming photons into measurable electrical signals.

Photon detectors are specialized devices designed to detect and quantify the presence of photons. They achieve this by absorbing photons and transforming them into electrical signals that can be recorded. The most prevalent type of photon detector is the photomultiplier tube (PMT), which comprises a photocathode, a series of dynodes, and an anode.

When a photon enters the PMT, it strikes the photocathode, leading to the emission of an electron. This emitted electron is then accelerated toward the first dynode, where it induces the release of several additional electrons. This amplification process continues at each successive dynode, resulting in a cascade of electrons that ultimately accumulate at the anode, producing a measurable electrical signal.

Another common type of photon detector is the avalanche photodiode (APD), which operates on principles similar to those of the PMT. In an APD, when a photon is absorbed by a semiconductor material, it generates an electron. This electron is then driven by a high electric field, prompting it to collide with other electrons and create additional electron-hole pairs. This process repeats, culminating in an avalanche of electrons that can be captured as an electrical signal.

Photon detectors find applications across a diverse range of fields, including medical imaging, particle physics experiments, and telecommunications. Their high sensitivity enables them to detect even single photons, making them indispensable tools in various research and technological domains.
