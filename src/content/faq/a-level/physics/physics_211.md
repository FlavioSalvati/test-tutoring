X-rays can cause ionization, resulting in tissue damage and an increased risk of cancer.

X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation characterized by high energy and short wavelengths. When X-rays pass through matter, they have the potential to ionize atoms and molecules, which can lead to damage in living tissue. This damage may result in mutations in DNA, subsequently elevating the risk of cancer. The likelihood of harm from X-rays is contingent upon the dose received; higher doses correlate with an increased risk of adverse effects.

Beyond their potential impact on human health, X-rays can also pose environmental hazards. X-ray machines and other sources of X-rays can contribute to the accumulation of radioactive waste, which may remain hazardous for thousands of years. Therefore, proper disposal and management of radioactive waste are crucial to minimize risks to both humans and the environment.

To mitigate the risks associated with X-ray exposure, it is essential to use X-rays only when necessary and to administer the lowest possible dose. Protective measures, such as lead aprons and shields, can significantly reduce exposure. Additionally, regular monitoring and maintenance of X-ray equipment are vital to ensure that it operates correctly and emits radiation at safe levels.
