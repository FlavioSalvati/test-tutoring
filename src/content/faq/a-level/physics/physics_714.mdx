Gravitational potential energy is a form of energy that is stored in an object because of its position within a gravitational field. It can be calculated using the formula:

$$
E = mgh
$$

In this equation, $E$ represents the gravitational potential energy, $m$ is the mass of the object, $g$ is the gravitational field strength, and $h$ is the height of the object above a specified reference point, which is typically considered to be ground level.

The gravitational field strength, denoted by the symbol $g$, quantifies the force acting on an object per unit mass in a gravitational field. On the surface of the Earth, $g$ is approximately equal to $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$. The height $h$ is measured in meters and indicates the vertical distance between the object and the reference point.

The gravitational potential energy of an object can be increased in two ways: by raising the object to a greater height or by increasing its mass. Conversely, it can be decreased by lowering the object to a lesser height or by reducing its mass.

In summary, the gravitational potential energy is determined using the formula:

$$
E = mgh
$$

where $m$ is the mass, $g$ is the gravitational field strength, and $h$ is the height. This formula is essential for calculating the amount of energy stored in an object due to its position within a gravitational field.
