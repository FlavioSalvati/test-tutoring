The principle behind Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans in nuclear medicine involves the detection of gamma rays emitted by positron-emitting radiotracers.

PET is a specialized imaging technique in nuclear medicine that utilizes radiotracers to create images reflecting the biological functions of the body. Radiotracers are molecules tagged with a positron-emitting radionuclide, such as fluorine-18 ($^{18}\text{F}$), carbon-11 ($^{11}\text{C}$), or oxygen-15 ($^{15}\text{O}$). Upon injection into the body, these radiotracers travel to specific tissues or organs and emit positrons. These positrons subsequently interact with nearby electrons, resulting in the production of gamma rays.

The emitted gamma rays are detected by a circular array of detectors surrounding the patient. These detectors capture both the location and intensity of the gamma rays. The data collected is then processed by a computer to generate a three-dimensional image of the distribution of the radiotracer throughout the body. This imaging capability is invaluable for diagnosing and monitoring a variety of conditions, including cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.

PET scans are particularly effective in identifying alterations in metabolism and blood flow, as well as in detecting the presence of abnormal cells or tissues. They are frequently employed in conjunction with other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to provide a more comprehensive view of the bodyâ€™s structure and functionality. Additionally, PET scans are non-invasive and generally exhibit minimal side effects, making them a safe and effective diagnostic tool for a wide range of medical conditions.
