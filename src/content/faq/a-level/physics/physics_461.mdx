The bulk modulus is fundamentally related to the compressibility of a material.

The bulk modulus quantifies a material's resistance to compression. It is defined as the ratio of the applied pressure to the resulting fractional decrease in volume. A higher bulk modulus indicates that the material is more resistant to compression, whereas a lower bulk modulus signifies a greater ease of compression.

Mathematically, the relationship between bulk modulus and compressibility can be expressed as:

$$
K = -V \left( \frac{dP}{dV} \right)
$$

In this equation, $K$ represents the bulk modulus, $V$ is the volume of the material, and $\frac{dP}{dV}$ is the rate of change of pressure with respect to volume. This formulation illustrates that the bulk modulus is inversely proportional to the material's compressibility.

In practical applications, materials with a high bulk modulus, such as diamond, are extremely difficult to compress, while those with a low bulk modulus, like rubber, can be easily compressed. Understanding this relationship is crucial in various fields, including the design of hydraulic systems, where materials with a high bulk modulus are often preferred to minimize excessive deformation under pressure.
