The phase of a wave refers to its position within its cycle, while phase difference denotes the positional shift between two waves.

In the context of a wave, the phase indicates the position of a specific point on the wave relative to a fixed reference point, such as the origin. Phase is quantified in degrees or radians and represents the fraction of the wave cycle that has been completed at that particular moment. For instance, a wave with a phase of $90^\circ$ has completed one-quarter of its cycle.

Phase difference, on the other hand, is the discrepancy in phase between two waves. This difference, also expressed in degrees or radians, illustrates the positional shift between the two waves. When two waves share the same frequency yet possess different phases, their interaction leads to characteristic interference patterns. Specifically, if the phase difference is $0^\circ$, the waves will interfere constructively, resulting in an increased amplitude. Conversely, if the phase difference is $180^\circ$, the waves will interfere destructively, which leads to a reduced amplitude.

Understanding phase difference is crucial in the study of wave interference and superposition, as it helps explain phenomena such as beats and standing waves. This concept is also vital in practical applications like signal processing and telecommunications, where controlling the phase of a signal is essential to achieving the desired outcomes. For a deeper exploration of how waves interact and influence one another, further reading is recommended.
