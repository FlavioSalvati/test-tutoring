Stars undergo a fascinating transformation into black holes when their mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, which is approximately $1.4$ solar masses.

As a star depletes its nuclear fuel, it loses the energy necessary to counteract the gravitational pull. If the star's mass is below the Chandrasekhar limit, it will collapse into a white dwarf, a stellar remnant supported by electron degeneracy pressure. However, when a star's mass exceeds this limit, electron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to halt further collapse, leading the star to continue collapsing until it ultimately forms a black hole.

In contrast, for stars with masses ranging from $8$ to $25$ solar masses, a different fate awaits. These stars will undergo a supernova explosion when their core exhausts its fuel and collapses. This collapse triggers the ejection of the outer layers into space. The explosion is initiated by a rapid release of energy during the core collapse, generating a shock wave that travels through the star's layers. This shock wave raises the temperature of the outer layers to millions of degrees, causing them to expand dramatically and be expelled into the surrounding space.

The ultimate fate of a star is intrinsically linked to its mass. Stars with masses less than $0.4$ solar masses will evolve into white dwarfs, while those with masses between $0.4$ and $8$ solar masses will become neutron stars. In cases where the mass exceeds $25$ solar masses, the star will collapse directly into a black hole without experiencing a supernova explosion. The exploration of stellar evolution and the diverse outcomes for stars of varying masses is a vital area of research in astrophysics.
