To determine the focal length of a lens, you can utilize the lens equation. 

The focal length of a lens is defined as the distance from the lens to the point where parallel rays of light converge after passing through the lens. The lens equation establishes a relationship between the focal length of the lens, the distance of the object from the lens, and the distance of the image from the lens.

The lens equation is expressed as:

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{o} + \frac{1}{i}
$$

In this equation, $f$ represents the focal length of the lens, $o$ denotes the distance of the object from the lens, and $i$ signifies the distance of the image from the lens. To apply this equation, you must measure both the object distance and the image distance. The distance of the object can be accurately measured using a ruler or tape measure, while the distance of the image can be determined using a screen or a piece of paper.

Once you have obtained these measurements, you can substitute the values into the lens equation to calculate the focal length of the lens. It is crucial to ensure that the units of measurement for all distances are consistent; for instance, if the object distance is measured in meters, the image distance should also be measured in meters.

In summary, the focal length of a lens can be determined by employing the lens equation, which connects the focal length to the distances of the object and the image. By measuring these distances and substituting them into the equation, you can find the focal length of the lens.
