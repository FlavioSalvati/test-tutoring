In particle physics, there are four fundamental forces that govern the interactions among particles: the strong force, weak force, electromagnetic force, and gravitational force. These forces are essential for understanding how matter behaves at the subatomic level.

1. **Strong Force**: The strong force is the most powerful of the four fundamental forces and is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom. This force is mediated by particles known as gluons.

2. **Weak Force**: The weak force plays a crucial role in processes such as radioactive decay. It is mediated by the exchange of particles called W and Z bosons.

3. **Electromagnetic Force**: The electromagnetic force governs the interactions between charged particles. It is mediated by photons and is responsible for various phenomena, including electricity, magnetism, and the behavior of light.

4. **Gravitational Force**: The gravitational force is the attraction that occurs between masses. It is theorized to be mediated by particles called gravitons, although these particles have not yet been observed.

While the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces have been unified under a single framework known as the electroweak theory, the gravitational force remains distinct and has not yet been successfully incorporated into this unified theory. The quest for a comprehensive theory that unifies all four fundamental forces is one of the central challenges in modern physics.
