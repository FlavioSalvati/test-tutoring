The unit of strain is dimensionless, as it represents a ratio of two lengths.

Strain is defined as the ratio of the change in length to the original length of an object. It quantifies how much an object deforms when subjected to stress. Strain can be expressed either as a decimal or as a percentage. For instance, if a wire measuring $10 \, \text{cm}$ in length is stretched to $11 \, \text{cm}$, the resulting strain can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Strain} = \frac{\text{Change in Length}}{\text{Original Length}} = \frac{11 \, \text{cm} - 10 \, \text{cm}}{10 \, \text{cm}} = \frac{1 \, \text{cm}}{10 \, \text{cm}} = 0.1
$$

This can also be expressed as $10\%$.

The reason strain is considered unitless is that both the change in length and the original length are measured in the same units, causing them to cancel each other out. Consequently, strain does not have any associated units. It is crucial to differentiate strain from stress, which is defined as the force applied per unit area on an object. Stress is measured in units of pressure, such as pascals ($\text{Pa}$) or newtons per square meter ($\text{N/m}^2$).

Strain can be either positive or negative, depending on whether the material is being stretched or compressed. A positive strain indicates that the object has elongated, while a negative strain signifies that it has contracted. Understanding strain is vital in engineering and materials science, as it plays a key role in assessing the strength and durability of materials under various conditions.
