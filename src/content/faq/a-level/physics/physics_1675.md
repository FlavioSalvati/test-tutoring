The work done during an adiabatic process can be determined using the first law of thermodynamics.

In an adiabatic process, there is no heat transfer between the system and its surroundings. As a result, the change in the internal energy of the system is equal to the work done on the system. This relationship is mathematically represented as:

$$
\Delta U = -W,
$$

where $\Delta U$ denotes the change in internal energy and $W$ represents the work done on the system.

To calculate the work done in an adiabatic process, one must first ascertain the change in internal energy. This can be accomplished using the ideal gas law, which connects the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas. For an adiabatic process, the ideal gas law can be expressed as:

$$
PV^\gamma = \text{constant},
$$

where $\gamma$ (gamma) is the ratio of specific heats.

Using this equation, we can derive an expression for the change in internal energy as follows:

$$
\Delta U = -W = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}(P_2V_2 - P_1V_1),
$$

where $P_1$, $V_1$, $P_2$, and $V_2$ correspond to the initial and final pressures and volumes of the gas, respectively.

It is crucial to note that this equation is applicable only to reversible adiabatic processes, where the system remains in equilibrium throughout. In the case of irreversible adiabatic processes, the work done cannot be calculated using this formula and must be determined through alternative methods.
