Nuclear medicine utilizes radioactive tracers to evaluate liver function and diagnose liver diseases.

Nuclear medicine is a specialized medical field that employs small quantities of radioactive substances, known as radiotracers, for the diagnosis and treatment of various medical conditions. In liver function tests, these radiotracers are injected into the patient's bloodstream and subsequently absorbed by the liver. As the radiotracers emit gamma rays, a specialized imaging device called a gamma camera detects these rays. The gamma camera then generates images that illustrate the liver's functionality and identify any potential abnormalities.

A commonly performed nuclear medicine liver function test is the hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan. During this procedure, a radiotracer known as technetium-99m HIDA is injected into the patient's bloodstream. The radiotracer is absorbed by the liver and subsequently excreted into the bile ducts. The gamma camera captures images of both the liver and bile ducts, allowing healthcare providers to assess how effectively the liver produces and excretes bile.

Another important nuclear medicine test is the positron emission tomography (PET) scan. In this test, a radiotracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is administered into the patient's bloodstream. The FDG is taken up by the liver cells and emits positrons, which are detected by a PET scanner. The PET scanner creates detailed images that reveal the liver's functionality and help identify any abnormalities, such as tumors.

In summary, nuclear medicine plays a crucial role in liver function testing by offering non-invasive and precise evaluations of liver health and aiding in the diagnosis of liver diseases.
