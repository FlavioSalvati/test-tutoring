The half-life of a radioactive element is defined as the time required for half of the initial quantity of the substance to undergo decay.

Radioactive decay occurs randomly, which means it is not possible to predict the exact moment when a specific atom will decay. However, by examining a large sample of atoms, scientists can forecast the decay rate using the concept of half-life. Specifically, the half-life is the time it takes for half of the initial number of radioactive atoms to decay.

To determine the half-life of a radioactive element, researchers conduct experiments that measure the decay rate of a sample over time. They typically plot their findings on a graph, where the y-axis represents the number of remaining atoms and the x-axis denotes time. The resulting graph depicts an exponential decay curve.

The half-life can then be calculated by identifying the time it takes for the number of remaining atoms to reduce to half of the original quantity. This is accomplished using the equation:

$$
N = N_0 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{T}}
$$

In this equation, $ N $ represents the number of remaining atoms, $ N_0 $ is the initial number of atoms, $ t $ is the elapsed time, and $ T $ is the half-life.

Understanding the half-life of a radioactive element is crucial for various applications, including radiometric dating and nuclear medicine.
