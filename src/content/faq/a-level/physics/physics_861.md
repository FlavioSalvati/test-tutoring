The lifecycle of low-mass stars significantly differs from that of high-mass stars due to their distinct internal processes.

Low-mass stars, such as our Sun, initiate their lifecycle as a cloud of gas and dust that collapses under its own gravitational force. Once the core temperature reaches approximately $15$ million degrees Celsius, hydrogen fusion commences, marking the star's entry into the main sequence phase. This phase is prolonged, lasting for billions of years, during which the star continuously fuses hydrogen into helium in its core. As the hydrogen supply diminishes, the star expands into a red giant, where it begins to fuse helium into heavier elements. Eventually, the outer layers of the star are expelled, leaving behind a remnant core that becomes a white dwarf.

In contrast, high-mass stars experience a more tumultuous lifecycle. They also form from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust, but their greater mass leads to a much faster consumption of their nuclear fuel. These stars possess higher core temperatures, which enable them to fuse heavier elements. As they exhaust their fuel supply, they undergo a series of explosive nuclear reactions, synthesizing heavier and heavier elements until they reach iron. At this stage, the star can no longer support itself against gravitational collapse, resulting in a catastrophic supernova explosion. The remnant core may ultimately become either a neutron star or a black hole.

In summary, while the lifecycle of a low-mass star is generally calm and predictable, that of a high-mass star is characterized by violent explosions and the creation of heavier elements.
