Wave frequency refers to the number of wave cycles that pass a given point in a specific time interval.

In physics, waves are characterized as disturbances that propagate through a medium, facilitating the transfer of energy from one location to another. The frequency of a wave measures how many times it oscillates within a defined time period. This quantity is typically expressed in hertz (Hz), which denotes the number of cycles per second.

The frequency of a wave is inversely proportional to its wavelength, which is defined as the distance between two consecutive points on a wave that are in phase. Consequently, waves with longer wavelengths exhibit lower frequencies, while those with shorter wavelengths display higher frequencies.

Frequency plays a crucial role in determining various properties of waves, including their speed, energy, and wavelength. For instance, in the context of electromagnetic waves, the frequency influences their color: higher frequencies correspond to colors at the blue end of the spectrum, while lower frequencies relate to colors at the red end.

In summary, wave frequency is a fundamental characteristic that quantifies how often waves oscillate over a specified period. Measured in hertz, it is inversely related to wavelength. A thorough understanding of wave frequency is vital across numerous fields of physics, including optics, acoustics, and electromagnetism.
