A CT scan, or computed tomography scan, employs X-rays to produce detailed images of the body's internal structures.

The fundamental principle of CT scanning is based on the attenuation of X-rays as they traverse various types of tissue. As X-rays pass through the body, they are absorbed by the tissues they encounter. The degree of X-ray absorption varies according to the density of the tissue: denser tissues, such as bone, absorb more X-rays compared to less dense tissues, like muscle or fat.

A typical CT scanner comprises an X-ray tube and a detector, which are positioned on opposite sides of a rotating gantry. During the scan, the patient lies on a table that moves through the gantry. Simultaneously, the X-ray tube and detector rotate around the patient, capturing multiple X-ray images from various angles. These images are subsequently processed by a computer to generate a detailed three-dimensional representation of the body's internal structures.

The advent of CT scanning has significantly transformed medical diagnosis and treatment, enabling healthcare professionals to identify and diagnose a broad spectrum of medical conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders. CT scans are particularly effective for imaging the brain, chest, and abdomen, and they are often utilized in emergency situations to quickly assess and address injuries. 

However, it is important to note that CT scans involve exposure to ionizing radiation, which may elevate the risk of developing cancer over time. Therefore, CT scans are typically performed only when the potential benefits outweigh the associated risks. In certain cases, alternative imaging modalities, such as ultrasound or MRI, may be preferred.
