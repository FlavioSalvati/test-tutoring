Young's modulus is inversely related to the ductility of a material.

Young's modulus serves as a measure of a material's stiffness, indicating its resistance to deformation when subjected to stress. It is defined as the ratio of stress to strain within the elastic region of a material's stress-strain curve. In contrast, ductility refers to a material's capacity to undergo plastic deformation prior to fracturing.

Materials exhibiting high values of Young's modulus are typically stiff and brittle, which means they tend to have low ductility. Such materials require a significant amount of stress to initiate deformation, making them more prone to fracturing rather than deforming plastically. Examples of these materials include ceramics and certain metals, such as tungsten and steel.

Conversely, materials with low Young's modulus values are generally more flexible and ductile. They can undergo deformation with less applied stress and are more likely to experience plastic deformation before breaking. Common examples of such ductile materials include rubber, polymers, and some metals like copper and aluminum.

Thus, the relationship between Young's modulus and ductility is indeed inverse: as Young's modulus increases, ductility decreases, and vice versa. Understanding this relationship is crucial when selecting materials for applications that necessitate specific mechanical properties.
