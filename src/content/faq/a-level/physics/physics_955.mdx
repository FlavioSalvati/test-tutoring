Self-induction in a coil is intrinsically linked to its inductance.

Inductance is a property of a coil that resists any change in the current flowing through it. When the current in a coil varies, it generates a magnetic field that induces an electromotive force (EMF) within the coil itself. This phenomenon is referred to as self-induced EMF, which acts to counteract the change in current that generated it.

The magnitude of the self-induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate of change of current in the coil. Consequently, a coil with a larger inductance will exhibit greater resistance to changes in current, resulting in a larger self-induced EMF.

The inductance of a coil can be calculated using the formula:

$$
L = \frac{N\Phi}{I}
$$

where:
- $L$ represents the inductance in henries,
- $N$ is the number of turns in the coil,
- $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux through the coil, and
- $I$ is the current flowing through the coil.

In summary, self-induction in a coil is directly related to its inductance. The inductance determines the magnitude of the self-induced EMF, which opposes any changes in the current flowing through the coil.
