Electric current is measured using an ammeter, which is connected in series with the circuit.

To measure electric current, the ammeter must be linked in series with the circuit. This configuration allows the current to flow through the ammeter, enabling it to accurately measure the amount of current passing through the circuit. It is crucial to connect the ammeter correctly: the positive terminal should be attached to the positive end of the circuit, while the negative terminal should be linked to the negative end. If the ammeter is incorrectly connected in parallel, it can create a short circuit, potentially damaging both the ammeter and the circuit.

Ammeters are specifically designed to have very low resistance, ensuring that they do not significantly affect the circuit they are measuring. They are typically calibrated in amperes ($A$), which is the standard unit of electric current. When the ammeter is connected in series with the circuit, the reading displayed on the ammeter indicates the amount of current flowing through the circuit at that specific moment.

It is important to emphasize that ammeters should only be used for measuring electric current, not for voltage or resistance. Attempting to measure voltage or resistance with an ammeter can lead to damage to both the ammeter and the circuit. To measure voltage, a voltmeter should be utilized, while an ohmmeter is the appropriate tool for measuring resistance.
