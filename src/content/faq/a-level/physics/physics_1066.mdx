The sun is destined to evolve through several stages: it will transform into a red giant, then a white dwarf, and eventually cool down over time.

As the sun continues to fuse hydrogen in its core, it will eventually exhaust this fuel, leading to its expansion into a red giant. During this phase, the outer layers of the sun will cool and expand, potentially engulfing Mercury and Venus. While Earth might survive this transformation, it will be too hot to sustain any form of life.

Following the red giant phase, the sun will shed its outer layers, transitioning into a white dwarf. At this stage, it will cease to generate energy through nuclear fusion and will gradually cool over billions of years. Ultimately, it will evolve into a black dwarf, a cold and dark remnant of a once-bright and powerful star.

The fate of our sun mirrors the life cycle of all stars, although the specific timing and characteristics of each star's evolution are influenced by its mass. For example, smaller stars do not undergo the red giant phase; instead, they simply fade away into white dwarfs.

Understanding the life cycle of stars, including our sun, is crucial for astronomers. It enhances their comprehension of the universe and aids in the study of the formation of planets and other celestial bodies.
