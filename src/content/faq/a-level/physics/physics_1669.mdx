Repeating measurements in an experiment is essential for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained. This practice is vital because measurements can be influenced by various sources of error, which can be broadly classified into random errors and systematic errors.

Random errors arise from unpredictable fluctuations during the measurement process, leading to variations in the results. In contrast, systematic errors are caused by consistent factors that affect measurements in the same manner each time. By conducting multiple measurements, scientists can mitigate the influence of random errors and identify systematic errors, allowing them to make necessary corrections. This approach ultimately strengthens the validity of the experimental findings.
