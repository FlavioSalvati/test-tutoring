Subatomic particles are accelerated using electric and magnetic fields within particle accelerators.

Particle accelerators are sophisticated devices designed to propel subatomic particles to high velocities. They operate by employing electric and magnetic fields to manipulate these particles. Initially, the particles are injected into the accelerator, where they traverse a series of electric fields that incrementally increase their speed. Following this, the particles enter a sequence of magnetic fields that bend their trajectories and focus them into a narrow beam.

There are two primary types of particle accelerators: linear accelerators and circular accelerators. Linear accelerators utilize a succession of electric fields to accelerate particles in a straight path. In contrast, circular accelerators combine both electric and magnetic fields to accelerate particles along a circular trajectory.

Particle accelerators have a broad spectrum of applications in both scientific research and medicine. They are instrumental in studying the properties of subatomic particles, creating new particles, and exploring the fundamental forces of nature. Additionally, they play a crucial role in medical applications, such as cancer treatment, where they are employed to deliver high-energy radiation to target cancer cells effectively.
