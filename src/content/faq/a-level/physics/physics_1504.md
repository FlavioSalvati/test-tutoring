An antiparticle is defined as a particle that possesses the same mass as its corresponding particle but has an opposite charge.

Antiparticles are fundamental components of matter that share the same mass as their corresponding particles while exhibiting opposite charge properties. For instance, the antiparticle of an electron is known as a positron, which carries the same mass as an electron but has a positive charge. When an antiparticle encounters its corresponding particle, they annihilate each other, resulting in the release of energy in the form of gamma rays.

The concept of antiparticles was first proposed by Paul Dirac in 1928, stemming from his relativistic equation for the electron. The existence of antiparticles was experimentally confirmed in 1932 when Carl Anderson identified the positron in cosmic rays. Since then, several other antiparticles have been discovered, including the antiproton, antineutron, and antineutrino.

Antiparticles play a crucial role in the field of particle physics, as they are instrumental in studying the properties of particles and the fundamental forces that govern their interactions. For example, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN accelerates particles and their antiparticles to high energies, allowing researchers to create new particles and investigate their characteristics. Additionally, antiparticles have practical applications, particularly in medical imaging and cancer treatment.
