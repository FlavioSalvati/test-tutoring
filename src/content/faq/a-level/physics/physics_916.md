The electric field strength is directly proportional to the charge that generates it.

Electric field strength quantifies the force experienced by a charged particle placed within an electric field. Specifically, it is defined as the force per unit charge acting on a test charge in the field. The electric field strength increases linearly with the magnitude of the charge producing it; thus, if the charge is doubled, the electric field strength at any given point will also double.

This relationship between electric field strength and charge can be mathematically expressed using Coulomb's law. According to Coulomb's law, the force between two point charges is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them. This law can be rearranged to derive the electric field strength at a specific point in relation to the charge creating the field and the distance from that charge to the point of interest.

In summary, electric field strength is directly proportional to the charge that produces it, a relationship articulated by Coulomb's law. This law connects the forces between two point charges to their respective magnitudes and the distance between them. Grasping this concept is essential across various domains of physics, including electrostatics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.
