The electric field strength within a charged sphere varies with the distance from its center.

As we approach the center of a charged sphere, the electric field strength increases. This increase occurs because the amount of charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface also increases as we move inward. According to Gauss's law, the electric field strength at any point inside a charged sphere is directly proportional to the charge enclosed within that Gaussian surface. Thus, as we move closer to the center, the charge enclosed increases, leading to a corresponding rise in the electric field strength.

However, when we arrive at the center of the sphere, the electric field strength becomes zero. This is because the amount of charge enclosed at the center is zero; consequently, according to Gauss's law, the electric field strength at this point is also zero.

As we then move away from the center of the sphere, the electric field strength begins to decrease. This decrease occurs because the charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface diminishes as we move outward from the center. Therefore, again following Gauss's law, the electric field strength at that point also decreases.

In summary, the electric field strength within a charged sphere changes with the distance from the center and is directly proportional to the charge enclosed within the corresponding Gaussian surface.
