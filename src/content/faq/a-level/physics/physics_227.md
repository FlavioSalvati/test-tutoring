Resonance is a phenomenon in which an object vibrates at its natural frequency when subjected to a periodic external force.

When an object experiences a periodic external force, it tends to vibrate at a frequency that matches its natural frequency. This occurrence is referred to as resonance. The natural frequency of an object is defined as the frequency at which it vibrates when disturbed from its rest position. When an external force is applied, it induces vibrations in the object. If the frequency of this external force aligns with the object's natural frequency, the amplitude of the vibrations can increase dramatically. This substantial increase occurs because energy from the external force is efficiently transferred to the object, resulting in greater vibrational amplitude.

Resonance can manifest in various systems that possess a natural frequency, including mechanical, electrical, and acoustic systems. In mechanical systems, resonance can lead to significant vibrations, and if the amplitude becomes excessive, it may cause the object to break apart. In electrical systems, resonance can destabilize circuits, potentially damaging electronic components. In acoustic systems, resonance can amplify sound waves, giving rise to a phenomenon known as feedback.

Understanding resonance is crucial in the field of physics and has numerous practical applications, such as in musical instruments, radio communication, and medical imaging. A solid grasp of resonance principles is vital for A-Level Physics students, as it is a foundational concept that underlies many areas of physics.
