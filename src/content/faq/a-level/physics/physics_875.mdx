The International System of Units (SI) defines the unit of luminous intensity as the candela (cd).

Luminous intensity quantifies the amount of light emitted by a source in a specific direction. This measurement is a fundamental aspect of photometry, the science that studies light and its properties. The candela is precisely defined as the luminous intensity in a given direction of a source emitting monochromatic radiation with a frequency of $540 \times 10^{12}$ Hz, which has a radiant intensity of $\frac{1}{683}$ watts per steradian in that direction.

As one of the seven base units in the SI system, the candela provides a standardized measurement framework and is derived from other base units. Its applications are diverse and include fields such as lighting design, photography, and astronomy. For instance, the brightness of a light bulb is typically expressed in lumens, which represent the total light output from the bulb, while the luminous intensity of stars is critical for determining their apparent magnitude, a measure of their brightness as observed from Earth.

In conclusion, the candela is the SI unit used to measure luminous intensity, reflecting the amount of light emitted by a source in a specified direction. This important quantity in photometry finds practical use across various domains, including lighting design, photography, and astronomy.
