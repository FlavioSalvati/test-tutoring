Lenses create images by refracting light rays so that they converge at a specific focal point.

When light rays travel through a lens, they are refracted, or bent, due to changes in the speed of light as it moves from one medium to another. The degree of refraction depends on both the shape of the lens and the angle at which the light rays enter it. A convex lens, often referred to as a converging lens, is characterized by being thicker in the center than at the edges. This design causes light rays to bend inward, converging at a focal point located on the opposite side of the lens. The distance from the lens to this focal point is termed the focal length.

In contrast, a concave lens, also known as a diverging lens, is thinner in the center than at the edges. It refracts light rays outward, resulting in a divergence of the rays. The focal point of a concave lens is virtual, indicating that it appears to be located behind the lens. The distance from the lens to this virtual focal point is also referred to as the focal length.

The type of image produced by a lens is influenced by the position of the object in relation to the lens and the distance between the lens and the image. When an object is situated beyond the focal point of a convex lens, it produces a real, inverted image on the opposite side of the lens. Conversely, if an object is placed within the focal length of a convex lens, a virtual, upright image is generated on the same side as the object. Notably, a concave lens consistently produces a virtual, upright image, regardless of the object's position.
