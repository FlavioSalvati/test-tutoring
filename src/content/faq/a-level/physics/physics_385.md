Ionizing radiation can inflict damage on living tissues, resulting in a range of harmful effects.

When ionizing radiation interacts with biological tissues, it can ionize atoms and molecules, leading to the generation of free radicals. These free radicals can subsequently react with other molecules within the body, causing damage to critical components such as DNA, proteins, and various cellular structures. This damage may result in mutations, cell death, and overall tissue injury.

The impact of ionizing radiation on living tissues is influenced by several factors, including the type of radiation, the radiation dose, and the duration of exposure. High doses of ionizing radiation can induce acute radiation sickness, characterized by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and, in severe cases, death. Conversely, chronic exposure to lower doses of ionizing radiation may elevate the risk of developing cancer and other serious diseases.

Despite its deleterious effects on living tissues, ionizing radiation also has beneficial applications, particularly in medical imaging and cancer therapy. It is crucial, however, to utilize ionizing radiation safely and responsibly, minimizing exposure to safeguard both patients and healthcare professionals.
