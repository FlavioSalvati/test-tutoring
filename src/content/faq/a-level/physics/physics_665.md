A cloud chamber is an instrumental device utilized for the detection of subatomic particles by observing their trajectories as they traverse a supersaturated vapor.

This chamber comprises a sealed container filled with a gas, such as air or hydrogen, which is cooled to a temperature below its dew point. This cooling process results in a supersaturated vapor, indicating that the vapor contains more water than it can typically retain at that specific temperature and pressure.

When a charged particle, such as an electron or a proton, enters the chamber, it ionizes the gas molecules along its path. This ionization creates a trail of ions that serve as nuclei around which the supersaturated vapor can condense. As the vapor condenses, it forms a visible track that can either be photographed or examined under a microscope.

The shape and curvature of the track yield valuable information regarding the particle's charge, mass, and energy. For instance, a positively charged particle will curve in one direction, while a negatively charged particle will curve in the opposite direction. The radius of curvature is directly related to the particle's momentum, which itself is a function of its mass and velocity.

Cloud chambers have been employed for over a century to investigate subatomic particles, and they remain an essential tool in contemporary physics research. They are relatively straightforward and cost-effective to construct, capable of detecting a diverse array of particles, ranging from cosmic rays to those generated in particle accelerators.
