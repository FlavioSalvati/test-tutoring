To calculate the power of a heat engine, it is essential to know both the amount of heat energy transferred and the time taken for this transfer.

The power of a heat engine represents the rate at which it converts heat energy into mechanical work. This is determined by dividing the work done by the time taken:

$$
P = \frac{W}{t}
$$

where $P$ is the power, $W$ is the work done, and $t$ is the time duration. The work done by the engine is defined as the difference between the heat energy absorbed ($Q_{in}$) and the heat energy rejected ($Q_{out}$). This relationship is crucial for understanding the efficiency of the engine.

The efficiency ($\eta$) of a heat engine is expressed as the ratio of the useful work output to the total heat input:

$$
\eta = \frac{W}{Q_{in}}
$$

It is important to note that the efficiency is always less than 1, as some heat energy is invariably lost to the surroundings during the operation of the engine. To enhance the efficiency of a heat engine, one can either increase the temperature of the heat source or decrease the temperature of the heat sink.

Furthermore, the power output of a heat engine can also be calculated using the formula:

$$
P = \frac{Q}{t}
$$

where $P$ represents the power, $Q$ denotes the heat energy transferred, and $t$ is the time taken. This formula is particularly useful when the efficiency of the engine is unknown.

In summary, the power of a heat engine is computed by dividing the work done by the time taken. The efficiency of the engine can be utilized to determine the work done, while the power output can also be calculated using the formula $P = Q/t$. By improving the engine's efficiency, one can potentially increase its power output.
