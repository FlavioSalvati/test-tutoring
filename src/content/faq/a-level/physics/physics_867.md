A supernova is a colossal explosion that occurs when a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, whereas a nova is a smaller explosion associated with a white dwarf star.

Supernovae represent the most powerful explosions known in the universe, releasing immense amounts of energy and leading to the formation of heavy elements. These dramatic events occur when a star's core collapses after it has depleted its fuel supply, resulting in a catastrophic explosion. There are two primary types of supernovae:

1. **Type I Supernovae**: These occur in binary star systems when a white dwarf accumulates excessive mass from its companion star, ultimately reaching a critical limit that triggers the explosion.
  
2. **Type II Supernovae**: These happen in massive stars when they run out of nuclear fuel, leading to the collapse of their cores and subsequent explosion.

In contrast, novae are smaller explosions that arise from a white dwarf star in a binary system. When the white dwarf gathers material from its companion star, it can become sufficiently hot to ignite a nuclear reaction on its surface. This reaction results in a sudden and significant increase in brightness. Unlike supernovae, novae do not obliterate the star, allowing them to occur multiple times over the star's lifetime.

In terms of luminosity, supernovae are vastly brighter than novae. Some supernovae can even be seen from Earth during the daytime, while novae typically require telescopes or binoculars for visibility.

In summary, while both supernovae and novae are explosive phenomena in the universe, they differ significantly in their underlying mechanisms, consequences, and overall intensity.
