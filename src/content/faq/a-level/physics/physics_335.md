To determine the efficiency of a heat engine, one must divide the useful output energy by the input energy.

The efficiency of a heat engine quantifies the extent to which input energy is transformed into useful output energy. This is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful Output Energy}}{\text{Input Energy}}
$$

In this context, the useful output energy refers to the energy utilized to perform work, while the input energy represents the total energy supplied to the engine.

It is important to note that the efficiency of a heat engine is always less than $100\%$, as a portion of the input energy is inevitably lost as waste heat. To enhance efficiency, one can either minimize the production of waste heat or maximize the generation of useful output energy.

The efficiency of a heat engine can be expressed in two forms: as a percentage or as a decimal. For instance, an engine with an efficiency of $0.4$ is capable of converting $40\%$ of the input energy into useful output energy. This efficiency metric is crucial for evaluating the performance of various types of engines and is often employed to make comparisons among them.

In summary, the efficiency of a heat engine is determined by dividing the useful output energy by the input energy. It is inherently less than $100\%$ and can be improved through the reduction of waste heat or the increase of useful output energy. The resulting efficiency can be presented either as a percentage or a decimal, serving as a key indicator of engine performance.
