Ductility is a critical property of materials that reflects their ability to deform under stress without fracturing. It is closely associated with the material's stress-strain curve, which illustrates the relationship between applied stress and the resulting strain.

When a material is subjected to stress, it experiences deformation. The extent of this deformation that a material can endure before it fails is referred to as its ductility. This property is particularly significant in engineering applications, where materials are often required to withstand various forces. Ductility is typically quantified by measuring either the percentage of elongation or the reduction in cross-sectional area of the material when it is subjected to a tensile force.

The stress-strain curve can be divided into three distinct regions: elastic, plastic, and fracture. 

1. **Elastic Region**: In this region, the material deforms elastically, meaning it will return to its original shape once the applied force is removed.
   
2. **Plastic Region**: Here, the material undergoes plastic deformation, which results in permanent changes to its shape.

3. **Fracture Region**: This final region is where the material ultimately fails and breaks.

The ductility of a material can be assessed from the stress-strain curve by examining the extent of plastic deformation that occurs prior to fracture. A material's ductility is directly related to its capacity to deform; the higher the ductility, the greater the degree of deformation it can sustain before breaking. 

Materials with high ductility, such as copper and aluminum, are commonly employed in applications that require significant deformation, such as in the manufacturing of wires and cables. Conversely, materials with lower ductility, like steel, are preferred in applications where strength is paramount, such as in construction.
