The induced electromotive force (EMF) in a coil is directly proportional to its area.

The induced EMF arises from changes in the magnetic flux through the coil. Magnetic flux ($\Phi$) is defined as the product of the magnetic field strength ($B$) and the area ($A$) of the coil that is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field. Consequently, as the area of the coil increases, both the magnetic flux and the induced EMF also increase.

This relationship is mathematically represented by Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, which states that the induced EMF ($\text{EMF}$) in a coil is equal to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the coil. This can be expressed as:

$$
\text{EMF} = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt}
$$

In this equation, $\text{EMF}$ represents the induced electromotive force, $\Phi$ denotes the magnetic flux through the coil, and $t$ indicates time. The negative sign in the equation signifies that the induced EMF acts in opposition to the change in magnetic flux, a principle known as Lenz's Law.

From a practical standpoint, increasing the area of a coil can be achieved by either adding more turns of wire to the coil or by enlarging the diameter of the coil itself. This enhancement is particularly beneficial in applications such as transformers, where the induced EMF is crucial for transferring energy between circuits. By increasing the area of the coil, the efficiency of the transformer can be significantly improved.
