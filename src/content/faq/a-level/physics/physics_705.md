A black hole contains a singularity, which is defined as a point of infinite density and zero volume.

When a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it succumbs to its own gravitational forces, resulting in the formation of a black hole. The gravitational pull of a black hole is so immense that nothing can escape its graspâ€”not even light. At the core of a black hole resides the singularity, a location where our current understanding of physics fails to hold. This singularity represents a point of infinite density and zero volume, where conventional laws of physics cease to be applicable.

Surrounding the singularity is the event horizon, which marks the boundary of no return for any object that crosses it. Once an object passes the event horizon, the gravitational force becomes so overpowering that escape is impossible. The event horizon effectively separates the interior of the black hole from the external universe.

The singularity is indeed a point of infinite density and zero volume, where the structure of spacetime becomes infinitely curved. At this point, the principles of general relativity break down, leading to a complete loss of predictability. The singularity represents the final stage of a massive star's collapse, existing in a realm where the established laws of physics no longer apply.
