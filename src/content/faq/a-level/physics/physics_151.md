Latent heat refers to the heat energy needed to change the state of a substance without altering its temperature. 

In contrast, sensible heat is the energy required to change the temperature of a substance without changing its state. When a substance is heated, it absorbs energy, resulting in an increase in temperature. This process is characterized by sensible heat. The quantity of sensible heat necessary to raise the temperature of a substance is determined by its specific heat capacity.

Conversely, latent heat is the heat needed to change a substance's state, such as transitioning from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas, while maintaining a constant temperature. During a phase change, energy is absorbed to overcome the molecular bonds within the substance. This absorbed energy is known as latent heat, and it does not lead to any change in temperature.

The amount of latent heat required for a state change is contingent upon the specific latent heat of the substance, which is defined as the energy necessary to change the state of one kilogram of that substance. For instance, the specific latent heat of fusion represents the energy required to convert one kilogram of a solid into a liquid.

In conclusion, sensible heat is the energy required to change a substance's temperature, whereas latent heat is the energy required to change a substance's state. Both concepts are crucial in the field of thermodynamics, aiding in the understanding of material behavior and energy transfer.
