Ultrasound Doppler imaging is a medical imaging technique that leverages the Doppler effect to accurately measure blood flow velocity.

The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency of sound waves caused by the relative motion between the source of the sound and the observer. In the context of ultrasound Doppler imaging, a transducer emits sound waves directed toward a specific area of interest, such as a blood vessel. These sound waves reflect off moving blood cells and return to the transducer. By comparing the frequency of the reflected sound waves to that of the emitted waves, the system can compute the velocity of blood flow based on the difference in frequency.

There are two primary types of Doppler ultrasound imaging: pulsed-wave Doppler and continuous-wave Doppler. Pulsed-wave Doppler transmits short bursts of ultrasound waves to measure blood flow velocity at a specific location, while continuous-wave Doppler employs a continuous stream of ultrasound waves to assess blood flow velocity over a larger area. This technology is frequently utilized to diagnose various medical conditions, including deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial disease, and heart valve abnormalities.

Beyond measuring blood flow velocity, ultrasound Doppler imaging can also provide insights into the direction of blood flow and detect any obstructions or irregularities within the blood vessels. As a non-invasive and safe imaging technique that does not utilize ionizing radiation, it serves as a valuable tool in medical diagnosis and treatment.
