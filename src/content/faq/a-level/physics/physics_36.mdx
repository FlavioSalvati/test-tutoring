Resonance is a fascinating phenomenon that occurs when an object vibrates at its natural frequency.

When an object is exposed to a periodic force that aligns with its natural frequency, resonance is triggered. This interaction leads to a significant increase in the amplitude of the object's vibrations. The energy from the periodic force is effectively transferred to the object, causing it to vibrate with greater intensity. This process is referred to as forced vibration.

Harmonic motion, on the other hand, describes a specific type of motion where an object vibrates at a frequency that is an integer multiple of its natural frequency. This motion is characterized by a sinusoidal waveform and is commonly known as simple harmonic motion.

The concepts of resonance and harmonic motion are closely intertwined, as both involve the vibration of an object at particular frequencies. In resonance, the object responds to a periodic force that matches its natural frequency, resulting in amplified vibrations. In contrast, harmonic motion occurs when an object vibrates at a frequency that is a multiple of its natural frequency, leading to a sinusoidal pattern.

In summary, resonance and harmonic motion are related phenomena that both involve the vibration of an object at specific frequencies. Resonance arises when an object is subjected to a periodic force that coincides with its natural frequency, while harmonic motion occurs when an object vibrates at a frequency that is an integer multiple of its natural frequency.
