Radiation doses are quantified using units known as sieverts (Sv).

The sievert is a measure of the amount of radiation absorbed by an individual or an object. Specifically, one sievert corresponds to one joule of energy absorbed per kilogram of tissue. However, given that this represents a considerable amount of radiation, doses are commonly expressed in smaller units: millisieverts (mSv) and microsieverts (Î¼Sv).

Various instruments are employed to measure radiation doses, including Geiger counters, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), and film badges. Geiger counters detect ionizing radiation by measuring the electrical charge generated when radiation interacts with a gas. In contrast, TLDs and film badges utilize materials that emit light when exposed to radiation. This luminescence can be measured after the materials are heated or developed, providing an indication of the radiation dose received.

In addition to direct measurement, radiation doses can also be estimated using mathematical models. These models consider various factors, such as the type of radiation, the distance from the radiation source, and the duration of exposure. They are essential for predicting the potential health effects of radiation exposure and for establishing safe exposure levels for workers in nuclear-related industries.

It is crucial to recognize that the effects of radiation doses can vary significantly based on the type of radiation and the specific body part exposed. For instance, alpha particles are generally more damaging than beta or gamma radiation. Additionally, exposure to the thyroid gland may result in different health consequences compared to exposure of the skin. Consequently, it is vital to assess the unique circumstances of each exposure when evaluating potential health risks.
