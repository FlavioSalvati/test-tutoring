To calculate power in a mechanical system, it is essential to know both the force applied and the distance moved.

Power is defined as the rate at which work is performed or energy is transferred. In mechanical systems, power can be determined by the formula:

$$
P = \frac{F \cdot d}{t}
$$

where:
- $P$ represents power,
- $F$ denotes the force applied,
- $d$ is the distance moved in the direction of the force, and
- $t$ is the time taken.

The standard unit of power is the watt (W), which is equivalent to one joule per second, or $1 \, \text{W} = 1 \, \text{J/s}$. Another commonly used unit is horsepower (hp), where $1 \, \text{hp} = 746 \, \text{W}$.

It is crucial to understand that power and energy are distinct concepts. Energy refers to the capacity to perform work, while power is the speed at which that work is accomplished. For instance, lifting a heavy object requires more energy than lifting a lighter one. However, if both objects are lifted the same distance within the same timeframe, the power expended in both cases will be identical.

In conclusion, to determine power in a mechanical system, you must know the force applied and the distance moved. Power is calculated by multiplying these two quantities and dividing the result by the time taken. Remember that power is measured in watts, and it is important to differentiate between power and energy.
