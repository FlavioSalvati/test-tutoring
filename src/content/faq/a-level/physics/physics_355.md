The SI unit for measuring power is the watt, denoted as $W$.

Power refers to the rate at which work is performed or energy is transferred. It is a scalar quantity, measured in watts ($W$) within the International System of Units (SI). Specifically, one watt is defined as the power required to accomplish one joule of work per second. This means that if a device consumes one watt of power, it is utilizing one joule of energy each second.

Power can also be represented in various other units, such as horsepower ($hp$) and kilowatts ($kW$). To provide context, one horsepower is equivalent to $746$ watts, and one kilowatt is equal to $1000$ watts. These alternative units are frequently used in the automotive and electrical sectors.

It is crucial to distinguish between power and energy. Energy is a scalar quantity measured in joules ($J$) and represents the capacity to perform work. In contrast, power indicates how quickly energy is transferred or work is executed. Consequently, a device may consume a significant amount of energy while exhibiting a low power output, or it may have a high power output but use energy slowly.

In summary, the SI unit of power is the watt ($W$), defined as the rate of work done at one joule per second. Other commonly used units include horsepower ($hp$) and kilowatts ($kW$).
