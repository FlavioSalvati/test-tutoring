Particle-antiparticle annihilation occurs when a particle encounters its corresponding antiparticle, leading to their mutual destruction.

During this process, the particle and its antiparticle annihilate one another, resulting in their mass being converted into energy according to Einstein's renowned equation, $E=mc^2$. This energy is subsequently released in the form of various other particles, such as photons or other elementary particles. Importantly, the total energy and momentum of the system are conserved throughout the annihilation process.

The specifics of the annihilation can vary depending on the types of particles involved. For instance, when an electron collides with a positron (the electron's antiparticle), they can annihilate each other, resulting in the production of two photons. In contrast, when a proton interacts with an antiproton, the annihilation can yield a diverse array of particles, including pions, kaons, and other mesons.

Particle-antiparticle annihilation is significant in numerous fields of physics, including particle physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. For example, it is believed to contribute to the gamma-ray emissions observed in regions of the universe where matter and antimatter are annihilating each other. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the annihilation process is essential for grasping the fundamental nature of matter and the universe as a whole.
