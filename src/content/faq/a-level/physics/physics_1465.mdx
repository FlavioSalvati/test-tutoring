Nuclear medicine is a specialized field that employs radioactive substances for both the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases, including cancer. 

In the context of cancer treatment, nuclear medicine focuses on delivering radiation directly to cancer cells, thereby reducing harm to surrounding healthy cells. This is primarily achieved through a technique known as radiation therapy, which utilizes high-energy radiation to eliminate cancer cells and reduce tumor size.

One notable method of nuclear medicine in cancer treatment is **brachytherapy**. This approach involves the placement of radioactive sources directly within or adjacent to the tumor, allowing for highly targeted radiation delivery. Another method is **systemic radiation therapy**, which consists of injecting a radioactive substance into the bloodstream. This enables the radioactive material to circulate throughout the body and specifically target cancer cells.

Nuclear medicine also plays a significant role in cancer diagnosis. A widely used diagnostic test in this field is the **positron emission tomography (PET) scan**. During a PET scan, a small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into the body. A specialized camera then detects the emitted radiation, creating detailed images of the body's cells and tissues. These images assist healthcare providers in identifying cancerous cells and determining the most appropriate treatment plan.

In conclusion, nuclear medicine is crucial in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. By utilizing radioactive substances to specifically target cancer cells, it provides a more precise and effective treatment option while minimizing damage to healthy tissues.
