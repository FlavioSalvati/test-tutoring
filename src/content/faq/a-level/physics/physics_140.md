The fundamental particles of matter consist of quarks and leptons.

Quarks and leptons serve as the essential building blocks of matter. Quarks are the smallest particles that combine to form protons and neutrons, which reside in the nucleus of an atom. There are six distinct types of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Each quark possesses a unique set of characteristics, including mass, electric charge, and spin.

In contrast, leptons are particles that do not engage with the strong nuclear force. There are six varieties of leptons: the electron, muon, tau, electron neutrino, muon neutrino, and tau neutrino. The electron is the most recognized lepton, as it is the particle responsible for carrying electric current in conductive materials.

Beyond quarks and leptons, there exist force-carrying particles known as bosons. These bosons mediate the interactions between quarks and leptons. Among them, the photon is the most prominent, as it facilitates the electromagnetic force.

The field dedicated to the exploration of these fundamental particles and their interactions is known as particle physics. A comprehensive understanding of the properties and behaviors of these particles is vital for grasping the nature of the universe and the fundamental laws that govern it.
