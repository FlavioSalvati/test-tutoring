To determine the uncertainty in a distance measurement using a ruler, it is essential to consider the smallest division on the ruler.

When measuring a distance, the smallest division represents the least precise measurement that can be accurately read. For instance, if the smallest division on the ruler is $1 \, \text{mm}$, the associated uncertainty in the measurement is $\pm 0.5 \, \text{mm}$. This indicates that the true distance could vary by up to $0.5 \, \text{mm}$ either above or below the measured value.

To compute the uncertainty of a distance measurement, simply divide the smallest division on the ruler by $2$. This approach assumes that the uncertainty is symmetrically distributed around the measured value. For example, with a smallest division of $1 \, \text{mm}$, the resulting uncertainty would be $0.5 \, \text{mm}$.

It's important to note that the uncertainty can be minimized by using a ruler with a smaller smallest division. For example, a ruler with a smallest division of $0.5 \, \text{mm}$ will yield a smaller uncertainty compared to one with a smallest division of $1 \, \text{mm}$.

In summary, to calculate the uncertainty in a distance measurement with a ruler, consider the smallest division and divide it by $2$. This will provide the uncertainty value, which is assumed to be evenly distributed around the measured distance.
