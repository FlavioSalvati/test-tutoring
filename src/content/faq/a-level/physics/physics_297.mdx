An optocoupler, also referred to as an opto-isolator, is an electronic device designed to provide isolation between two circuits by utilizing light.

An optocoupler typically comprises a light-emitting diode (LED) and either a phototransistor or a photodiode. When a voltage is applied to the LED, it emits light, which is then detected by the phototransistor or photodiode. The intensity of the light detected is directly proportional to the voltage applied to the LED.

The primary function of an optocoupler is to isolate two circuits that operate at different voltage levels, which could potentially lead to damage or interference if they were directly connected. The input circuit is connected to the LED, while the output circuit interfaces with the phototransistor or photodiode. When a voltage is applied to the input circuit, the LED emits light, and this light is subsequently detected by the phototransistor or photodiode. As a result, a current flows in the output circuit, which corresponds to the voltage applied to the input circuit.

Optocouplers are widely used in electronic circuits to achieve electrical isolation between high-voltage and low-voltage systems. This isolation helps prevent noise and interference, as well as protects sensitive components from potential damage. Additionally, they play a crucial role in digital communication systems, such as fiber-optic networks, enabling the transmission of data over long distances without interference.

In summary, an optocoupler operates by employing light to isolate two circuits with differing voltage levels. It consists of an LED and a phototransistor or photodiode, which detect the light emitted by the LED and convert it into a proportional current in the output circuit.
