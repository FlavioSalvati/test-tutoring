Lead is commonly used as a shield against X-rays due to its density and ability to absorb radiation effectively.

X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation that can penetrate various materials and potentially harm living tissues. To safeguard individuals from the detrimental effects of X-rays, shields constructed from dense materials are essential. Lead is particularly favored for X-ray shielding because it is a heavy metal with a high atomic number, indicating that it contains a substantial number of protons in its nucleus. This characteristic allows lead to be an efficient absorber of X-rays.

When X-rays traverse a material, they can interact with the atoms within that material, leading to a process known as ionization. This ionization can result in the creation of free radicals, which may damage cells and DNA. However, when X-rays encounter lead, the high atomic number of lead atoms enhances the interaction between the X-rays and the lead, increasing the likelihood of absorption. Consequently, a smaller amount of radiation passes through the lead shield, thereby reducing the risk of harm to individuals positioned on the opposite side.

In addition to its elevated atomic number, lead's density allows it to accommodate a significant number of atoms in a compact volume. As a result, lead shields can be relatively thin and lightweight while still providing substantial protection against X-rays. It is important to recognize, however, that lead is not an infallible barrier against X-rays. Other materials, such as concrete and steel, may also be employed for shielding depending on the specific requirements of the application.
