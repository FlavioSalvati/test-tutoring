During a nuclear reaction, mass is transformed into energy, as described by Einstein's renowned equation:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

Nuclear reactions involve either the splitting (fission) or the combining (fusion) of atomic nuclei, leading to a release or absorption of energy. This energy is emitted in various forms, including radiation such as gamma rays and particles like alpha and beta particles. The amount of energy released is directly proportional to the mass that is converted, in accordance with Einstein's equation.

In a nuclear fission reaction, a heavy nucleus is divided into two smaller nuclei, resulting in the release of a substantial amount of energy. This energy is effectively harnessed in nuclear power plants to produce electricity. Conversely, in a nuclear fusion reaction, two lighter nuclei merge to create a heavier nucleus, releasing even greater amounts of energy. This fusion process is the fundamental source of energy for the sun and other stars.

It is crucial to understand that the total mass and energy of the system are conserved before and after the reaction. However, while the total remains constant, the distribution of mass and energy changes: some mass is converted into energy, and some energy is emitted as radiation or particles. This conversion of mass into energy is what renders nuclear reactions both immensely powerful and potentially hazardous.
