The SI unit for electric current is the ampere, denoted as $A$.

Electric current refers to the flow of electric charge through a conductor. The ampere is defined as the constant current that, when maintained in two infinitely long, straight, parallel conductors with negligible circular cross-sections placed one meter apart in a vacuum, produces a force of $2 \times 10^{-7}$ newtons per meter of length between the conductors.

In practical terms, one ampere of current corresponds to one coulomb of charge passing through a conductor in one second. This relationship can be mathematically represented by the equation:

$$ I = \frac{Q}{t} $$

where $I$ is the current measured in amperes, $Q$ is the charge in coulombs, and $t$ is the time in seconds.

Electric current is measured using an ammeter, which is connected in series within the circuit. It is crucial for the ammeter to possess very low resistance to prevent interference with the current being measured.

Understanding the unit of electric current is vital in various fields of physics, such as electromagnetism and electronics. Moreover, it plays a key role in practical applications, including electrical wiring and the design of electrical circuits.
