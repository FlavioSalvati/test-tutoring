Young's modulus, often referred to as the modulus of elasticity, quantifies a material's stiffness and its capacity to resist deformation when subjected to external forces. It is defined as the ratio of stress to strain within the elastic limit of a material. The unit of measurement for Young's modulus is pascals (Pa).

To determine Young's modulus, a sample of the material is subjected to either tensile or compressive forces using a device known as a tensile testing machine. This machine applies a force to the sample and measures the resulting deformation, or strain. Stress is calculated by dividing the applied force by the cross-sectional area of the sample. The resulting stress-strain relationship is plotted on a graph, and the slope of the linear portion of this curve represents the Young's modulus of the material.

Young's modulus is a crucial property for materials, as it influences their ability to endure external loads without undergoing permanent deformation. This property is extensively utilized in engineering and design to select appropriate materials for various applications, such as constructing buildings or manufacturing components. Materials with a high Young's modulus, like steel and titanium, are favored in applications where strength and stiffness are paramount. Conversely, materials with a lower Young's modulus, such as rubber and plastics, are preferred in scenarios where flexibility and elasticity are essential.
