Electron capture is a nuclear process in which a proton-rich nucleus absorbs an inner-shell electron.

In this process, a proton-rich nucleus captures an inner-shell electron, typically from the K-shell. This electron combines with a proton, resulting in the formation of a neutron and the emission of a neutrino. As a consequence, the atomic number of the nucleus decreases by one, while the neutron-to-proton ratio increases, enhancing the stability of the nucleus. The energy released during electron capture is carried away by the neutrino, which is a neutral particle with a low mass that interacts weakly with matter.

Electron capture is a specific type of radioactive decay that occurs in certain isotopes, such as potassium-40 ($^{40}\text{K}$), which decays to argon-40 ($^{40}\text{Ar}$) through this process. Furthermore, electron capture plays a significant role in the formation of neutron stars, where extreme gravitational fields can induce electron capture in atomic nuclei, resulting in the creation of neutron-rich matter.

This phenomenon can be detected by observing the characteristic X-rays emitted when an outer-shell electron fills the vacancy left by the captured inner-shell electron. This detection method is employed in X-ray spectroscopy to identify the elements present in a sample.

In summary, electron capture is a crucial process in nuclear physics, with important applications in fields such as astrophysics and materials science.
