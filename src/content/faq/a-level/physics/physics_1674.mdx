The magnetic field within a toroid is concentrated, while the field outside is relatively weak.

A toroid is a donut-shaped structure that features a coil of wire wrapped around it. When an electric current flows through this coil, a magnetic field is generated. Inside the toroid, the magnetic field lines are both concentrated and uniform, running parallel to the axis of the toroid. This configuration occurs because the shape of the toroid confines the magnetic field lines, which are influenced by the current flowing through the coil. Specifically, the strength of the magnetic field inside the toroid is directly proportional to both the number of turns in the coil and the current flowing through it.

Conversely, the magnetic field outside the toroid is weak and non-uniform. In this region, the magnetic field lines disperse in all directions and are not confined by the toroid's shape. As a result, the strength of the magnetic field diminishes rapidly with increasing distance from the toroid. The intensity of the magnetic field outside depends on several factors: the distance from the toroid, the number of turns in the coil, and the current flowing through it.

The concentrated magnetic field within a toroid has numerous practical applications, particularly in devices such as transformers and inductors. The uniformity of the magnetic field facilitates efficient energy transfer between the coil and the core of the toroid. Additionally, the weak magnetic field outside the toroid enhances safety, allowing it to operate in close proximity to other electronic devices without causing interference.
