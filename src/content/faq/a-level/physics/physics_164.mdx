The Doppler effect, in relation to distant galaxies, refers to the change in the wavelength of light due to their motion through space.

When light emitted from a distant galaxy reaches Earth, its wavelength may shift toward the red end of the spectrum, known as redshift, or toward the blue end, referred to as blueshift. This phenomenon occurs as a result of the galaxy's motion relative to our position. Specifically, if a galaxy is moving away from us, the light waves are elongated, leading to an increase in wavelength and resulting in a redshift. Conversely, if a galaxy is approaching us, the light waves are compressed, causing a decrease in wavelength and resulting in a blueshift.

The Doppler effect serves as a valuable tool for determining the speed and direction of a galaxy's motion. By analyzing the degree of redshift or blueshift in the light we observe from a galaxy, astronomers can calculate its velocity relative to our own location. This data is crucial for studying the large-scale structure of the universe and understanding the distribution of galaxies within it.

Moreover, the Doppler effect provides compelling evidence for the expansion of the universe. The observation that nearly all distant galaxies display a redshift indicates that they are moving away from us, and from each other, at an accelerating pace. This observation supports the theory of cosmic inflation, which suggests that the universe experienced a rapid expansion shortly after the Big Bang.
