The amplitude in simple harmonic motion refers to the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position.

In simple harmonic motion, an object oscillates back and forth around a central equilibrium point. The amplitude, denoted by the symbol $ A $, represents the greatest distance the object moves away from this equilibrium position. It is measured in meters (m).

To determine the amplitude, you can measure the object's displacement from its equilibrium position at any moment in time. This measurement can be accomplished using a ruler or another measuring device. The amplitude can be calculated by taking the absolute value of the displacement and dividing it by 2. 

Alternatively, the amplitude can be computed using the formula:

$$
A = \frac{x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}}{2}
$$

where $ x_{\text{max}} $ is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position and $ x_{\text{min}} $ is the minimum displacement.

The amplitude of a simple harmonic motion system is intrinsically linked to its energy. Specifically, a larger amplitude indicates a higher energy level in the system. This relationship arises because a greater amplitude means the object travels a longer distance during each oscillation, thus requiring more energy. To deepen your understanding of this concept, consider exploring further resources on the topic.
