To assess the uncertainty associated with a mean value, we calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM).

The uncertainty of a mean value serves as an indicator of the precision of that mean. It is derived from the SEM, which represents the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. The SEM can be computed using the formula:

$$
\text{SEM} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

where $s$ is the standard deviation of the sample and $n$ is the sample size.

For instance, consider a sample consisting of $10$ measurements with a standard deviation of $2$. The SEM in this case would be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{SEM} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{10}} \approx 0.63
$$

This result indicates that the uncertainty of the mean value is approximately Â±$0.63$.

Furthermore, the uncertainty of the mean can be expressed through a confidence interval. A $95\%$ confidence interval implies that there is a $95\%$ likelihood that the true population mean lies within this interval range. The confidence interval is calculated by multiplying the SEM by the appropriate t-value for the desired confidence level and then adding and subtracting this value from the mean.

It is crucial to recognize that the uncertainty of the mean can be minimized by either increasing the sample size or enhancing the precision of the measurements. Additionally, it is essential to report the uncertainty of the mean alongside the mean value itself to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data.
