Capacitors and inductors exhibit distinct behaviors in alternating current (AC) circuits compared to direct current (DC) circuits.

In AC circuits, capacitors and inductors respond uniquely due to the alternating nature of the current. Capacitors store energy in an electric field and are capable of blocking DC current while allowing AC current to flow through. The reactance of a capacitor is inversely proportional to the frequency; specifically, as the frequency increases, the impedance of the capacitor decreases. This characteristic is effectively utilized in AC circuits to filter out unwanted frequencies and to store energy.

Conversely, inductors store energy in a magnetic field and can block AC current while permitting DC current to pass. The reactance of an inductor is directly proportional to the frequency; that is, as the frequency increases, the impedance of the inductor also increases. This property is similarly leveraged in AC circuits to filter out unwanted frequencies and to store energy.

In AC applications, capacitors and inductors can be combined to form resonant circuits. These circuits can be tuned to a specific frequency, enabling them to selectively filter out unwanted frequencies while amplifying desired ones. This capability is particularly important in radio receivers and transmitters, where resonant circuits are employed to select precise frequencies.

In summary, capacitors and inductors behave differently in AC circuits compared to DC circuits. Their unique properties are harnessed in AC circuits to filter out unwanted frequencies, store energy, and create resonant circuits.
