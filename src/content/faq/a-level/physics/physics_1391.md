The process of nuclear fusion varies significantly among stars of different masses due to differences in temperature and pressure.

In low-mass stars, such as our Sun, nuclear fusion predominantly occurs in the core via the proton-proton chain. This reaction involves the fusion of hydrogen nuclei ($^1H$) to produce helium ($^4He$), while releasing energy in the form of gamma rays and neutrinos. The core's temperature and pressure in these stars are insufficient to initiate the fusion of heavier elements.

Conversely, in high-mass stars, fusion primarily occurs through the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. This process requires higher temperatures and pressures than those found in the proton-proton chain. Additionally, high-mass stars possess a convective core, which facilitates the mixing of elements and enhances the efficiency of fusion reactions.

As high-mass stars evolve, they undergo a series of fusion reactions that ultimately lead to the production of iron ($^{56}Fe$). Notably, the fusion of iron does not release energy; therefore, when the core's composition shifts to predominantly iron, it collapses under its own gravity, resulting in a supernova explosion.

In summary, the nuclear fusion processes in stars are closely tied to their mass. Higher-mass stars exhibit elevated temperatures and pressures in their cores, enabling the fusion of heavier elements. The ultimate fate of a star is also influenced by its mass and the fusion reactions it experiences throughout its life cycle.
