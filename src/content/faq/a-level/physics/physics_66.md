Energy transfer during a collision occurs through the exchange of kinetic energy between colliding objects.

When two objects collide, they exert forces on each other that result in changes to their velocities. This change in velocity leads to a transfer of kinetic energy between the objects. The amount of kinetic energy transferred during the collision depends on the masses and velocities of the objects involved.

In an elastic collision, the total kinetic energy of the objects before the collision is equal to the total kinetic energy after the collision, indicating that kinetic energy is conserved and no energy is lost during the interaction. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
KE_{\text{initial}} = KE_{\text{final}}
$$

Conversely, in an inelastic collision, a portion of the kinetic energy is lost due to deformation or the objects sticking together. As a result, the total kinetic energy after the collision is less than it was before the collision:

$$
KE_{\text{final}} < KE_{\text{initial}}
$$

The coefficient of restitution, denoted as $e$, quantifies the elasticity of a collision. It is defined as the ratio of the relative velocity of separation to the relative velocity of approach. In mathematical terms, it can be expressed as:

$$
e = \frac{v_{\text{separation}}}{v_{\text{approach}}}
$$

A perfectly elastic collision has a coefficient of restitution of $1$, indicating complete energy conservation, while a completely inelastic collision has a coefficient of restitution of $0$, signifying that the objects stick together with no kinetic energy remaining in the system.

In summary, the energy transfer during a collision is a complex phenomenon influenced by various factors such as the masses, velocities, and elastic properties of the objects involved. Understanding these factors is essential for predicting the outcomes of collisions and for developing effective safety measures.
