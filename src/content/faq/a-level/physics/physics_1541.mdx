A solar cell converts sunlight into electrical energy through a phenomenon known as the photovoltaic effect.

Solar cells, often referred to as photovoltaic cells, are composed of semiconductor materials, primarily silicon. When sunlight strikes the cell, it excites electrons within the semiconductor, causing them to move and generate an electric current. This fundamental process is known as the photovoltaic effect.

To enhance their functionality, semiconductor materials are doped with impurities, resulting in the formation of a p-n junction. The p-type material contains an abundance of positively charged "holes," while the n-type material is rich in negatively charged electrons. When these two types of materials are combined, a potential difference arises at the junction, prompting electrons to migrate from the n-type material to the p-type material.

This movement of electrons establishes a flow of electric current, which can be harnessed to power various electrical devices. Typically, solar cells are connected in series to boost the voltage and in parallel to increase the current output.

The efficiency of a solar cell is influenced by several factors, including the type of semiconductor material used, the thickness of the cell, and the wavelength of the incident light. Researchers are continuously striving to enhance the efficiency of solar cells, aiming to make them a more viable and sustainable source of renewable energy.
