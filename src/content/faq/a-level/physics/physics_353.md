Scientists investigate the early universe through a combination of observational data and theoretical frameworks grounded in fundamental physics principles.

One significant method of studying the early universe involves observing the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). This radiation represents the residual heat from the Big Bang and offers a glimpse into the universe when it was merely $380,000$ years old. By analyzing the CMB, researchers can glean valuable information about the temperature, density, and composition of the early universe.

Another approach is the utilization of particle accelerators. These sophisticated machines replicate the high-energy conditions that prevailed in the early universe, enabling scientists to examine the fundamental particles and forces that were present at that time. By investigating the behavior of these particles, researchers can gain insights into the conditions that characterized the early universe.

Additionally, scientists employ theoretical models based on core principles of physics to deepen their understanding of the early universe. These models integrate concepts such as the Big Bang theory, quantum mechanics, and general relativity to predict the universe's behavior during its formative stages. By comparing these predictions with observational data, scientists can refine and enhance their comprehension of the early universe.

In conclusion, scientists leverage a multifaceted approach that includes observations, particle accelerators, and theoretical models to study the early universe, thereby uncovering its properties and behavior more effectively.
