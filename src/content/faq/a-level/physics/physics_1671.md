Hawking radiation refers to the emission of particles from a black hole, a phenomenon attributed to quantum effects.

This theoretical prediction was introduced by physicist Stephen Hawking in 1974. It challenges the notion that black holes are entirely black, suggesting instead that they emit particles as a result of quantum mechanical processes. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, particles can spontaneously arise and vanish in a vacuum. Near the event horizon of a black hole, this leads to a scenario where one particle may be captured by the black hole while its partner escapes into space. This results in a net loss of mass for the black hole, a process known as Hawking radiation.

The rate at which Hawking radiation is emitted is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole. In other words, smaller black holes emit radiation at a higher rate compared to their larger counterparts. However, the actual amount of radiation produced by a black hole is exceedingly minimal, making direct observation highly unlikely. Despite this, the concept of Hawking radiation has significantly deepened our understanding of black holes and the fundamental nature of gravity.

Furthermore, Hawking radiation has important implications for the long-term fate of black holes. As they emit radiation, they gradually lose mass and may eventually evaporate entirely. This phenomenon is referred to as black hole evaporation, which is anticipated to occur over a timescale of trillions of years for a typical black hole. The concept of black hole evaporation has given rise to the so-called information paradox, a subject that remains an active area of research in theoretical physics.
