The fracture point refers to the specific moment at which a material fails and breaks under applied stress.

The stress-strain curve is a graphical representation that illustrates the relationship between stress and strain in a material. This curve provides insights into how a material responds to stress and how it deforms when subjected to strain. Typically, the curve is divided into three distinct regions: the elastic region, the plastic region, and the fracture region.

In the **elastic region**, the material exhibits elastic deformation, which means it can return to its original shape once the applied stress is removed. This behavior is characterized by a linear relationship between stress and strain, governed by Hooke's Law. 

In the **plastic region**, the material undergoes plastic deformation, indicating that it will not return to its original shape after the stress is removed. This region represents the beginning of permanent deformation, where the material has been altered structurally.

The **fracture region** is where the material ultimately fails and breaks under stress. The fracture point, which marks the transition to this region, is typically found at the end of the stress-strain curve, following the plastic region. 

Identifying the fracture point is crucial for engineers and materials scientists, as it defines the maximum stress that a material can endure before failure occurs. By analyzing the stress-strain curve, engineers can accurately determine the fracture point and design materials capable of withstanding the stresses they will encounter in real-world applications.
