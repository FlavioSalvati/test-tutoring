In simple harmonic motion, energy changes involve the conversion between kinetic and potential energy.

Simple harmonic motion refers to the oscillatory movement of an object around its equilibrium position, where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from this position. As the object oscillates, its kinetic energy and potential energy vary, yet the total mechanical energy remains constant. At the equilibrium position, the object possesses maximum potential energy while having zero kinetic energy. As the object moves away from equilibrium, potential energy decreases and kinetic energy increases. At the point of maximum displacement, the object achieves its greatest kinetic energy, with potential energy at zero. As it returns to the equilibrium position, kinetic energy decreases and potential energy increases.

The total mechanical energy of the system, which is the sum of kinetic and potential energies, remains unchanged throughout the motion. This phenomenon is captured by the principle of conservation of energy. However, in real-world scenarios, energy losses may occur due to factors such as friction. These losses can lead to a gradual decrease in the amplitude of the motion over time, a phenomenon known as damping.

In conclusion, the energy changes in simple harmonic motion consist of the interconversion between kinetic and potential energy, while the total mechanical energy remains constant. The principle of conservation of energy holds true, though energy losses due to damping can occur in practical situations.
