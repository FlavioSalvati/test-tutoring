Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is an advanced form of MRI that quantifies the movement of water molecules within the brain.

DTI is a non-invasive imaging technique that leverages MRI technology to assess the diffusion of water molecules in the brain's white matter. White matter primarily consists of axons, which are long, slender fibers responsible for transmitting signals between various regions of the brain. By analyzing the diffusion patterns of water molecules, DTI provides valuable insights into the integrity and organization of these axons, making it an important tool for investigating brain development, injuries, and various neurological diseases.

The DTI process involves the application of a magnetic field gradient to the brain, which influences the movement of water molecules in specific directions. The resulting motion of these molecules is captured through MRI, allowing the creation of detailed maps of the brain's white matter. These maps illustrate both the direction and magnitude of water diffusion, which can be interpreted to deduce the orientation and structural organization of axons.

DTI has a wide range of applications in neuroscience, facilitating research into brain development, aging, and a variety of diseases. For instance, DTI can be employed to investigate the impacts of traumatic brain injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, it can be utilized to evaluate the effects of pharmaceuticals and other interventions on the white matter of the brain.
