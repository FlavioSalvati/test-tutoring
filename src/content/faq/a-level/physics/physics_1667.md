A hadron is a subatomic particle composed of quarks, which are held together by the strong nuclear force.

Hadrons consist of quarks, elementary particles that exist in six distinct types. The two most prevalent types of hadrons are protons and neutrons, which are found in the atomic nucleus. Protons carry a positive charge, whereas neutrons are electrically neutral. Other forms of hadrons include mesons, which consist of a quark paired with an antiquark, and baryons, which are formed from three quarks.

The strong nuclear force is the fundamental interaction responsible for binding quarks within a hadron. It is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, alongside gravity, electromagnetism, and the weak nuclear force. Among these, the strong force is the most powerful, but it operates effectively only over very short distances.

Hadrons are crucial in the field of particle physics, as they are the particles most frequently generated in high-energy collisions. By investigating the properties of hadrons, physicists can gain insights into the fundamental forces and particles that constitute the universe. Additionally, hadrons are essential to the structure of matter, serving as the building blocks of atomic nuclei.
