X-ray diffraction is a powerful technique used to analyze the structure of materials at the atomic and molecular level. It operates by directing a beam of X-rays onto a crystal, causing the atoms within the crystal to scatter the X-rays in various directions.

When X-rays are scattered, they interfere with one another, resulting in a characteristic pattern of bright spots and dark areas on a detector. This pattern is known as a diffraction pattern and provides critical information about the arrangement of atoms within the crystal. By measuring the angles of the diffracted beams, researchers can calculate the distances between atoms in the crystal lattice.

This technique finds applications across numerous fields, including chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. It is instrumental in determining the structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules, as well as in investigating the properties of metals, ceramics, and various other materials.

In summary, X-ray diffraction operates by shining X-rays onto a crystal and measuring the angles of the diffracted beams. This method yields valuable insights into the atomic and molecular structure of materials and is extensively utilized in many scientific disciplines.
