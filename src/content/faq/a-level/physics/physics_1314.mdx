The Chandrasekhar limit defines the maximum mass that a white dwarf star can possess before it succumbs to gravitational collapse.

White dwarf stars are the remnants of low-mass stars that have depleted their nuclear fuel and subsequently collapsed. These stars are extraordinarily dense, possessing a mass similar to that of the Sun, yet their radius is only about the size of Earth. The pressure that counterbalances gravitational collapse in a white dwarf is known as electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure arises from the Pauli exclusion principle, which dictates that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.

As a white dwarf accumulates mass, its density escalates, resulting in electrons being packed even more closely together. Eventually, the electron degeneracy pressure fails to provide adequate support against gravity, leading to the star's collapse. This collapse can ignite a runaway nuclear fusion reaction, culminating in a Type Ia supernova.

The Chandrasekhar limit, which is approximately $1.4$ times the mass of the Sun, or about $2.7 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$, represents the threshold mass for a white dwarf. If a white dwarf exceeds this limit, it will inevitably collapse and explode as a Type Ia supernova. This characteristic makes Type Ia supernovae invaluable tools for measuring astronomical distances, as they exhibit consistent luminosity and can act as standard candles.
