The work performed in stretching a wire is intricately linked to the elastic potential energy that the wire stores.

When a force is applied to stretch the wire, work is done against the wire's restoring force. This work gets converted into elastic potential energy, which is the energy stored in an object when it is deformed and can be released when the object returns to its original shape.

The quantity of elastic potential energy stored in a wire is directly proportional to the work done in stretching it. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\text{Elastic potential energy} = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

Here, $k$ represents the spring constant of the wire, and $x$ denotes the amount by which the wire is stretched.

The connection between the work done and the elastic potential energy stored in a wire is illustrated in the graph of force versus extension. The area beneath the graph corresponds to the work done in stretching the wire, which is equal to the elastic potential energy stored within it.

In conclusion, the work done in stretching a wire is closely related to the elastic potential energy that the wire accumulates. The greater the work done in stretching the wire, the more elastic potential energy is stored within it.
