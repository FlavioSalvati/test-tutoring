Muons decay via the weak interaction, transforming into an electron, two neutrinos, and energy.

Muons are unstable particles that undergo decay through the weak interaction, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. This interaction plays a crucial role in various processes, including beta decay, where a neutron in an atomic nucleus is converted into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. Specifically, in muon decay, the muon transforms into an electron, two neutrinos, and energy.

The decay of a muon is inherently a random process, making it impossible to predict the exact moment when a particular muon will decay. However, physicists have successfully measured the average lifetime of a muon, which is approximately $2.2 \, \mu s$ (microseconds). This implies that if a large collection of muons is present, we can expect about $2.2\%$ of them to decay within any given microsecond.

Muon decay is a significant phenomenon in particle physics, as it allows researchers to study the characteristics of the weak interaction. By analyzing the rate and energy distribution of the decay products, physicists can test the predictions made by the Standard Model of particle physics, which encompasses the behavior of all known particles and forces. Furthermore, muon decay has practical applications, including its use in medical imaging and radiation therapy.
