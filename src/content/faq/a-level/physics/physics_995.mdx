The elastic properties of solids describe their capacity to deform under stress and subsequently return to their original shape. These properties are assessed using various testing methods, including tensile testing, compression testing, and shear testing.

**Tensile Testing**: This method involves applying a force to a material in opposite directions, effectively stretching it. The resulting stress-strain curve can be analyzed to determine the material's Young's modulus, denoted as $E$. Young's modulus quantifies the stiffness of the material, indicating how much it will deform under tensile stress.

**Compression Testing**: In this method, a force is applied to a material in the same direction to induce compression. The stress-strain curve generated from this test helps calculate the material's bulk modulus, represented as $K$. The bulk modulus measures the material's resistance to uniform compression.

**Shear Testing**: This technique applies forces to a material in opposite directions but parallel to one another. The resulting stress-strain curve allows us to determine the material's shear modulus, denoted as $G$. The shear modulus indicates the material's resistance to deformation when subjected to shear stress.

Additional elastic properties of solids include Poisson's ratio, represented as $\nu$, which defines the ratio of lateral strain to axial strain, and the elastic limit, which is the maximum stress a material can endure without experiencing permanent deformation.

Understanding these elastic properties is crucial for the design and engineering of structures that must withstand various forces and stresses, ensuring safety and durability in practical applications.
