The kinetic theory of gases provides a fundamental framework for understanding the behavior of gases through the motion of their constituent particles.

According to this theory, gases consist of tiny particles—either atoms or molecules—that are in constant random motion. These particles are treated as point masses, meaning they possess no volume, and are separated by considerable distances compared to their size. The particles engage in collisions with one another and with the walls of their container. Importantly, these collisions are considered perfectly elastic, indicating that no kinetic energy is lost during the interaction.

Furthermore, the theory posits that the intermolecular forces between the particles are negligible, meaning that they do not exhibit significant attraction or repulsion towards one another. The temperature of a gas is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles; consequently, higher temperatures correspond to greater average speeds of the particles.

The kinetic theory of gases can effectively elucidate various macroscopic properties of gases, such as pressure, volume, and temperature. For instance, the pressure exerted by a gas is linked to both the frequency and the force of the collisions that occur between its particles and the walls of the container. Similarly, the volume of a gas correlates with the amount of space occupied by its particles, while the temperature reflects the average kinetic energy of these particles.
