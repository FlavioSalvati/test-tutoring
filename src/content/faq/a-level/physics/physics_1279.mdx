To calculate the electric field produced by a line of charge, we can apply Coulomb's Law and perform an integration.

Coulomb's Law states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their magnitudes and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them. In the case of a continuous line of charge, we can extend this principle.

To find the electric field at a specific point $ P $ due to a line of charge, we consider an infinitesimal segment of charge $ dQ $ along the line. We then calculate the electric field generated by this segment at point $ P $. The total electric field at point $ P $ is obtained by integrating the contributions from all infinitesimal segments along the entire length of the line of charge.

The formula for the electric field $ E $ resulting from a line of charge can be expressed as:

$$
E = k \lambda \int \frac{ds}{r^2}
$$

In this equation:
- $ E $ represents the electric field,
- $ k $ is Coulomb's constant,
- $ \lambda $ denotes the linear charge density of the line,
- $ ds $ is an infinitesimal length element of the charged line, and
- $ r $ is the distance from the charge element $ ds $ to the point $ P $.

The integral in this formula can be evaluated using calculus techniques, enabling us to determine the electric field at point $ P $. This electric field can subsequently be utilized to calculate the force acting on any charged particle placed at that point.
