Compressive stress refers to the internal resistance an object experiences when a force is applied to it, pushing the object together. Conversely, tensile stress occurs when a force pulls an object apart, resulting in internal resistance against this separation.

When a force is applied to an object, it generates stress, which is the internal force that counteracts the applied external force. There are two primary types of stress: compressive stress and tensile stress. 

- **Compressive Stress**: This type of stress arises when a force acts to compress the object, effectively pushing its ends together. The result is often a reduction in the object's length and an increase in width. 
- **Tensile Stress**: In contrast, tensile stress occurs when a force is exerted to pull the object apart. This results in the object becoming longer and narrower.

The maximum stress an object can endure before failure is known as its strength. The strength of a material is influenced by its inherent properties, such as elasticity and ductility. Elastic materials can tolerate significant stress without permanent deformation, while ductile materials can undergo considerable stretching and deformation before they ultimately fail.

In engineering, it is crucial to assess the stress that structures will face in order to ensure their safety and reliability. Engineers employ stress analysis techniques to evaluate the stresses that materials will encounter under various conditions. This analysis enables the design of structures capable of withstanding anticipated stresses, thereby minimizing the risk of failure.
