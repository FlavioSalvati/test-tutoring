Brittle materials fracture easily, while ductile materials can deform without breaking.

Brittle materials are characterized by their tendency to break under stress or strain with little to no prior deformation. This lack of ductility means that they cannot absorb significant energy before failure. Common examples of brittle materials include glass, ceramics, and certain metals such as cast iron. When subjected to stress, a brittle material will break suddenly and without warning, often producing sharp edges and hazardous shards. For further insights into material behavior under stress, see [insert reference].

In contrast, ductile materials can undergo significant deformation without fracturing. This means they can be stretched or bent to a considerable extent before reaching their breaking point. Typical examples of ductile materials include copper, aluminum, and various types of steel. When exposed to stress, a ductile material will gradually deform until it ultimately fails. This property makes ductile materials particularly suitable for applications that require flexibility and resilience, such as in construction and engineering. To gain a deeper understanding of how materials stretch and bend, explore [insert reference].

In summary, the primary distinction between brittle and ductile materials lies in their ability to deform prior to breaking. Brittle materials fracture suddenly and unexpectedly, whereas ductile materials can endure stretching or bending without immediate failure. Understanding the properties of different materials is crucial across various fields of physics, including materials science, engineering, and mechanics.
