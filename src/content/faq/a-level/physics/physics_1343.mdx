Energy transformation in a spring-mass system involves the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy and vice versa.

When a spring-mass system is displaced from its equilibrium position, it stores potential energy due to the deformation of the spring. As the spring attempts to return to its equilibrium position, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, causing the mass to move. Once the mass passes the equilibrium position, it compresses the spring again, converting its kinetic energy back into potential energy. This process creates a continuous cycle of energy transformation between potential and kinetic forms.

At any given moment, the amounts of potential and kinetic energy in the system can be calculated using the formulas for elastic potential energy and kinetic energy. Importantly, the total energy of the system remains constant throughout this process, reflecting the principle of energy conservation.

The frequency of oscillation, or the rate at which the mass moves back and forth, is determined by two factors: the mass of the object and the stiffness of the spring. A stiffer spring or a heavier mass results in a higher frequency of oscillation, while a softer spring or a lighter mass leads to a lower frequency.

In summary, the energy transformation in a spring-mass system is a fundamental concept in physics, with significant implications in various fields of science and engineering.
