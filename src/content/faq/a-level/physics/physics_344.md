The work performed on a gas during a thermodynamic process can be calculated using the following expression:

$$ W = \int P \, dV $$

To determine the work done on a gas, it is essential to know its pressure and volume. In this formula, $W$ represents the work, $P$ denotes the pressure of the gas, and $dV$ signifies the differential change in volume.

In cases where the pressure remains constant, the formula simplifies to:

$$ W = P \Delta V $$

Here, $\Delta V$ represents the change in volume of the gas. This equation is particularly applicable to processes such as isobaric expansion or compression.

Conversely, if the volume of the gas remains constant, the work done is zero, as there is no change in volume. This scenario is typical in processes like isochoric heating or cooling.

For processes where both pressure and volume change, the work done can be computed by integrating the pressure-volume curve. This involves dividing the curve into small segments and calculating the work done for each segment. The total work done is then obtained by summing the work contributions from all segments.
